<p class="hangingindent"><span class="smcap">Vernacular Name</span>:&mdash;<i>Blawe-bock</i> of Dutch (<i>Le
Vaillant</i>).</p>

<p>Size much less than in the two following species; height at withers
from 45 inches (♂ in Paris) to 40 inches (♀ in Vienna). General colour
bluish grey. Forehead brown; upper lip and a patch in front of the
eye lighter than the general colour, but there are none of the marked
black and white contrasts so prominent in <i>H. equinus</i>. Ears not
so long or so pointed as in <i>H. equinus</i>, and without black tufts
at their tips. Mane on nape of neck short, inconspicuous, directed
forward; throat-mane almost or quite absent. Belly dull whitish, not
contrasted with the sides. Limbs with an inconspicuous darker line down
their anterior surfaces. Tail-tuft greyish, but little darker than the
general colour.</p>

<p>Skull probably merely differing from that of <i>H. equinus</i> by its
smaller size, but, so far as is known, no museum possesses an example
of it.</p>

<p>Horns like those of <i>H. equinus</i>, but much smaller and more
slender; perhaps rather longer in proportion to the size of the animal.
Those of the Paris specimen (a male) measure 21½ inches in length round
the curve and have 28 rings upon them. The pair in the British Museum
are rather shorter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Hab.</i> Cape Colony only. (Exterminated at the end of the
last century.)</p>
</div>

<p>The Blue-buck, like the Quagga (<i>Equus quagga</i>), belongs to the
category of larger animals that have become extinct within the historic
period. While the Square-lipped Rhinoceros (<i>Rhinoceros simus</i>)
and the Mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> Zebra (<i>Equus zebra</i>) are still occasionally
to be met with in one or two remote districts of South Africa, it
would seem that the Blue-buck and the Quagga, as living creatures,
have utterly perished from the face of the earth, and are only now
represented by a few specimens in some of the principal museums of
Europe.</p>

<p>Although the “Blaauwe-bok” or “Blau-bok” was long known to early
travellers at the Cape under its vernacular names, the great Russian
naturalist Pallas was the first to register it definitely in the
‘Annals of Science.’ Under the name <i>Antilope leucophæa</i> Pallas
described it in 1766, in his ‘Miscellanea Zoologica,’ from a specimen
in the Leyden Museum<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, and placed it as the first species of his
genus <i>Antilope</i>. We have already, however (Book of Ant. III.
p. 3), given the reasons why another species&mdash;the Black-buck of
India&mdash;should be deemed to be the type of Pallas’s generic term
<i>Antilope</i>, and in accordance with ordinary usage we employ
Sundevall’s name <i>Hippotragus</i> for the present species and its
allies.</p>

<p>The next author after Pallas to mention this Antelope appears to
have been Allamand, who made various contributions to an edition of
Buffon’s ‘Histoire Naturelle,’ issued in Holland by Schneider in 1766
and the following years. Allamand, however, carelessly confounded this
South-African Antelope with the <i>Gazella gutturosa</i> of Siberia,
of which the native name is Tzeiran or Dzéren (see Book of Ant. III.
p. 84), and adopted the same name for it. Allamand’s figure of his
“Tzeiran” was taken from a mounted specimen in the Cabinet d’Histoire
Naturelle of J. C. Sylvius von Lennep, of Harlem, which on the death
of the owner had passed by bequest to the Société Hollandaise des
Sciences of that city. This specimen, when in skin, had been obtained
from a dealer who did not know whence it came, but from the mode of its
preparation it was believed by Allamand to have been brought from the
Cape.</p>

<p>Our countryman Pennant, in his ‘History of Quadrupeds,’ of which the
first edition was published in 1781, gave a third original description
of this species, which he called the “Blue Antelope.” It was taken,
he tells us, from a skin bought at Amsterdam, and said to have been
obtained from the Cape of Good Hope. Pennant fully recognized its
identity with Buffon’s “Tzeiran,” and remarked on the use of this
erroneous Asiatic name for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span></p>

<p>Sparrman, who arrived at the Cape in 1772 and subsequently made a long
journey into the interior, tells us in his narrative<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of having
found a skin of the Blue-buck (which he identified with Pallas’s
<i>A. leucophæa</i> and Pennant’s “Blue Antelope”) preserved at
“Krakeel-rivier,” but he does not appear to have met with it alive
himself.</p>

<p>But a rather later explorer of the Cape Colony, the well-known French
naturalist François Le Vaillant, author of the ‘Oiseaux d’Afrique’ and
many other ornithological works, was more fortunate. As Le Vaillant
appears to have been the only traveller known to have himself obtained
an example of this now extinct species, we will extract from the first
volume of his ‘Voyage d’Afrique’ what he has written on this subject.</p>

<p>On December 18th, 1781, Le Vaillant left Capetown to explore the
country to the east called “Hottentot Holland.” A few days later,
after crossing the river Sonder-end, and passing through the valley of
Soete-Melck, he arrived at a place called “Tiger-Hoek,” where he had
appointed some Hottentots to meet him, and went on the chase in their
company:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Nous eûmes bientôt joint quelques troupes de Gazelles; le
pays en étoit couvert; mais elles se tenoient toujours hors de
portée. Enfin, après avoir bien couru, mon chasseur m’arrêtant
tout d’un coup, me dit qu’il aperçoit un <i>Blawe-Bock</i>
(un Bouc bleu) couché. Je porte les yeux vers l’endroit qu’il
m’indique et ne le vois pas. Il me prie alors de rester
tranquille et de ne faire aucun mouvement, m’assurant de me
rendre maître de l’animal. Aussitôt il prend un détour, se
trainant sur ses genoux; je ne le perdois pas de vue, mais je
ne comprenois rien à ce manège nouveau pour moi. L’animal se
lève et bronte tranquillement sans s’éloigner de la place.
Je le pris d’abord pour un cheval blanc; car, de l’endroit
où j’étois resté, il me paroissoit entièrement de cette
couleur (jusques-là je n’avois point encore vu cette espèce
de Gazelle): je fus détrompé lorsque je vis ses cornes. Mon
Hottentot se trainoit toujours sur le ventre, il s’approacha
de si près et si promptement que mettre l’animal en joue et
le tirer fut l’affaire d’un instant; la Gazelle tomba du
coup. Je ne fis qu’un saut jusques-là et j’eus le plaisir de
contempler à mon aise la plus rare et la plus belle des Gazelles
d’Afrique. J’assurai mon Hottentot que, de retour au camp, je
le recompenserois généreusement. Je l’envoyai aussitôt chercher
un cheval pour transporter la chasse. L’intelligence de cet
homme et les divers moyens qu’il avoit employés pour surprendre
l’animal me rendoient son service important et précieux; je
me proposois bien de me l’attacher par tous les appâts qui
séduisent les Hottentots. Je commençai par lui donner une forte
provision de tabac et je joiguis à ce présent de l’amadoue, un
briquet et l’un de mes meilleurs couteaux. Il se servit de ce
dernier meuble et se mit à dépecer l’animal avec la même adresse
qu’il l’avoit tué. J’en conservai soigneusement la peau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span></p>

<p>“Cette Gazelle a été décrite par Pennant, sous le nom
d’<i>Antilope bleu</i>; par Buffon, sous le nom de
<i>Tzeiran</i>. Ce dernier Naturaliste a donné la figure d’une
partie de ses cornes; elle est rare et très-peu connue. Lors de
ma résidence en Afrique, je n’ai vu que deux de ces Gazelles et
une autre qui fut aportée au Gouverneur, quelques années après;
pendant l’un de mes séjours à la Ville. Elles venoient, comme la
mienne, de la vallée Soete-Melk, seul canton qu’elles habitent.
On m’avoit assuré que j’en verrois dans le pays des grands
Namaquois; malgré toutes mes informations et perquisitions j’ai
été trompé dans cette attente. Tout les Sauvages m’ont assuré
ne point la connoître. On m’avoit encore attesté que la femelle
portoit des cornes ainsi que le mâle; je ne puis rien dire
là-dessus, puisque les seules que j’aye vues étoient toutes
trois de ce dernier genre.</p>

<p>“Sa couleur principale est un bleu léger, tirant sur le
grisâtre; le ventre et l’intérieur des jambes dans toute
leur longueur font d’un, blanc de neige; sa tête surtout est
agréablement tachetée de blanc.</p>

<p>“Je n’ai pas remarqué que cette Gazelle, vivante, ressemblât à
du velours bleu, et que, morte, sa peau changeât de couleur,
comme le dit M. Sparrman. Vivante ou morte, elle m’a paru
toujours semblable. La teinte de celle que j’ai rapportée
n’a jamais varié. J’en ai vu une autre à Amsterdam, que l’on
conservoit depuis plus de quinze ans. Il en étoit de même
de celle du Gouverneur du Cap; plus fraîche encore que la
mienne, dans tout le reste elles étoient pareilles. Je ne puis
m’empêcher d’ajouter ici que je ne reconnois pas beaucoup cet
animal dans les dessins et les gravures que j’en ai vus jusqu’à
présent. Dans mes descriptions, je donnerai celle que j’ai faite
de celui-ci, et le dessin très exact que j’en ai tiré sur les
lieux, avant qu’on le déshabillât.”</p>

<p>After Le Vaillant’s time little further addition was made to the
history of this Antelope until the publication (in 1811 and 1812)
of Lichtenstein’s ‘Travels in Southern Africa,’ in which several
allusions to it will be found. In the first of these Lichtenstein,
on the way from Swellendam to Algoa Bay in December 1803, tells us
that much game&mdash;Antelopes and Zebras&mdash;was met with in the mountains
near the Buffalo-jagt River, “but the beautiful Blau-bok (<i>Antilope
leucophæa</i>) is, as Barrow has correctly supposed, almost
exterminated. In the year 1800 one was shot, of which the skin is
now at Leyden, but since then no more have been seen.” In the second
volume of his ‘Reise,’ when on the Dweika, between Stellenbosch
and Graaf Reinet, in the following December, Lichtenstein informs
us that game was plentiful in the inner valleys of the mountains,
and continues:&mdash;“Here are still found the Zebra, the Bontebok,
and the Reh-bok in comparative abundance, and even the Blau-bok
(<i>Antilope leucophæa</i>, which is almost exterminated elsewhere,
is said to occur occasionally.” In his celebrated article upon the
genus <i>Antilope</i>, published in the ‘Magazin der Gesellschaft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
naturforschender Freunde zu Berlin,’ two years subsequently,
Lichtenstein, after a description of this species from the specimen
at Berlin, continues as follows:&mdash;“The skin which I describe is,
unfortunately, the last that has been seen. Since 1799, when this
specimen was shot, no more have been met with, and it is known that
this Antelope was found only in the now well-populated district of
Zwellendam, and nowhere else. Apparently this beautiful animal is now
quite extinct.”</p>

<p>The animal having been thus exterminated towards the end of the
last century, its very existence became a matter of doubt to some
naturalists, who were inclined to consider the specimens of it left in
our museums as small or immature individuals of the nearly allied Roan
Antelope (<i>H. equinus</i>). This view was taken by Andrew Smith<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>,
de Blainville, Gray, and even Harris, who, one would think, might have
learned better from the traditions on the subject prevalent among the
Boers. But the accurate Sundevall was strongly against this opinion,
and, after examining the specimens at Upsala, Stockholm, and Paris,
said decidedly “<i>Minimè animal fictum, ut credidit A. Smith</i>.”
Sundevall, however, failed to convert Gray on this subject, and Gray,
although, as he tells us, he had examined the specimen at Paris, chose
to unite this species to the Roan Antelope, and to call them both
<i>Hippotragus leucophæus</i>.</p>

<p>The most recent authority to vindicate the claims of the Blue-buck
to specific distinctness is Herr F. F. Kohl, of Vienna, who, in an
article upon new and rare Antelopes in the Imperial Natural History
Museum, published in 1866, after accurately describing the specimen in
that collection and pointing out its distinctive characters from <i>H.
equinus</i>, gave a full list of the various synonyms to be allocated
to these two species.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt, therefore, that <i>Hippotragus
leucophæus</i> must be regarded as an extinct animal, of which at the
present time five mounted specimens only are known to exist. All these
we have already alluded to, but we may repeat that they are to be found
in the Museums of Paris, Leyden, Vienna, Stockholm, and Upsala.</p>

<p>Finally, however, we are glad to be able to add that, although our
National Collection does not contain a complete example of this
species, yet it possesses a frontlet and horns which, after careful
comparison, we have no hesitation in referring to <i>H. leucophæus</i>.
The horns (fig. 88, p. 11) are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span> just 20 inches in length and 6·1 in
basal circumference; they have the characteristic ridging and curvature
of the horns of the male, and are obviously adult, but their size is
less than the horns of the female Roan Antelope. The frontlet on which
they are borne measures 3·85 inches between the orbits. The exact
origin of this frontlet is not known, but it has been long in the
Museum.</p>

<p>Our illustration of the Blue-buck (Plate LXXVI.) was put upon stone by
Mr. Smit many years ago, from a water-colour sketch by Mr. Wolf, which
is now before us. This sketch was drawn by Mr. Wolf under Sir Victor
Brooke’s directions, probably from the specimen at Paris, which we
believe Sir Victor examined more than once, but we regret to say that
there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span> no certainty on this point. It should be mentioned, however,
that the elongation of the hairs on the neck shown in the Plate is
probably rather exaggerated, as this species, we are told by Sundevall,
had only a very short “neck-mane.”</p>

General colour greyish, browner in the two northern subspecies. Top
and sides of face black, contrasting markedly with the white muzzle
and lips and with a prominent patch just in front of the eyes. On the
lower half of this patch the hairs are elongated into a brush. Behind
the eyes a second less conspicuous white patch is present. The black,

face nearly uniform with the body. Ears very long, narrow, pointed,
their tips pencilled with black. Mane well developed, brown, directed
backward, except just on the withers, where there is a tendency for
it to be whorled. Throat-mane long and prominent. Belly white, its
definition laterally rather variable. Limbs brownish fawn, black
patches occasionally present on the outer sides of the shoulders and
forearms. Tail reaching to the hocks, its brush black.</p>

<p>It is a well-known and generally accepted fact amongst naturalists that
animals which have a wide distribution have also a special tendency
to vary, and that if specimens of them from different parts of their
ranges are compared, such specimens are usually found not to agree
exactly, but to be distinguishable by differential characters more or
less evident. When these characters are easily observable and definable
their possessors are usually referred to different species, which are
supposed to “represent” one another in their respective areas, and are
hence often called “representative species.” When the distinguishing
characters are slight and less easily recognizable it has recently
become the practice, especially among American naturalists, to
designate their possessors as “subspecies,” and, in order to indicate
this, to add a third “subspecific” name to the ordinary generic and
specific terms. This plan we have already adopted in some cases in the
present work. But there are many cases in which, either from imperfect
evidence or from an insufficient supply of specimens, it is very
difficult to decide whether a “local form,” as it may be termed, is
better treated of as a species or as a subspecies. And in the present
instance we have one of these cases before us. The Roan Antelope is
very widely distributed in Africa. From the Cape Colony it extends
all up the eastern side of the continent to British East Africa and
Sennaar, and is also found on the west coast in Senegal, Togoland,
Nigeria, and Angola. Specimens from all these countries present a very
general resemblance, and have been considered by most authorities to be
identical. On the contrary, other writers have regarded the local forms
as distinct, and have separated them under different specific names.
We confess that we have not been able (mainly, no doubt, from lack of
sufficient specimens to consult) to come to a satisfactory conclusion
on this subject; but, for the present, we think it a more prudent
course to treat the local forms of this species found in the different
districts of Africa as only of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span> subspecific rank, and to class them all
under the one specific head as <i>Hippotragus equinus</i>.</p>

<p>The Roan Antelope received its specific name as long ago as 1804,
when a short description of it was published by Desmarest in the
twenty-fourth volume of the first edition of the ‘Dictionnaire
d’Histoire Naturelle,’ taken from a specimen in the Paris Museum.
Desmarest designated it by the French name “Antilope Osanne,” but
added Geoffrey’s MS. scientific name “<i>Antilope equina</i>” which
must, therefore, be attributed to the former author, as having first
published it. Desmarest states that the exact locality of this
specimen was unknown, but we think it may be safely assumed to have
been from the Cape. Desmarest’s description is not very accurate, but
Desmoulins, who wrote the article “Antilope” in the subsequently issued
‘Dictionnaire Classique d’Histoire Naturelle,’ added a figure of the
head of Geoffrey’s type, which seems to prove that it could have been
of no other than the present species.</p>

<p>The first European explorer in South Africa to meet with the Roan
Antelope in its native wilds appears to have been Samuel Daniell,
who visited the Cape about the commencement of the present century
under the patronage of Lieut.-General Francis Dundas, at that time
Acting Governor. In his ‘African Scenery and Animals’ (of which the
original folio series was issued in parts in 1804 and the following
years) Daniell figured what was, there is little doubt, an example
of this Antelope under the name of “<i>The Tackhaitse</i>” (no. 24),
and informs us, in the accompanying letterpress, that he met with two
of these animals near Latakoo (or Kuruman) in Bechuanaland, where
“they are usually found grazing on the edge of the Karroo Plains near
the foot of the hills in small herds of five or six.” Upon Daniell’s
“Tackhaitse” Schinz founded his <i>Capra œthiopica</i>, Goldfuss his
<i>Capra barbata</i>, and Fischer his <i>Antilope truteri</i>; but all
these names are happily subsequent in date to the specific term usually
adopted for this Antelope, and need not concern us further.</p>

<p>After Daniell the next traveller to meet with the Roan Antelope appears
to have been Dr. Burchell, who was at the Cape from 1811 to 1815. In
his ‘List of Quadrupeds presented to the British Museum,’ as part of
the results of this memorable expedition, Burchell records a male of
<i>Antilope equina</i>, “shot at the Little Klibbolikhónni Fountain
in the Transgariepine” (now Orange Free State) in December 1812. In
Hamilton Smith’s fourth volume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span> of the Mammals of Griffith’s ‘Animal
Kingdom’ a full description is given of this specimen (of which a pair
of horns now alone remains in the National Collection), accompanied by
a good uncoloured figure of it drawn by Thomas Landseer.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Smith, whose journeys in the Cape districts took place from
1834 to 1836, published a coloured figure of this Antelope in 1840, in
his ‘Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa,’ and gives us the
following account of its distribution in those days:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The range of this species is very wide, and specimens have been
found wherever Southern Africa has been explored. Not very many
years ago the animal was frequently seen within the northern
boundary of the Cape Colony, and if we are to credit the
statements of the aborigines there was a time when it occurred
much more to the southward than even the locality alluded to,
and from which it has now in a great measure, if not completely,
disappeared. It is an animal which congregates, and commonly
from six to twelve individuals are found associated together.
Herds of this description are generally met in districts
abounding with small hills or hilly ridges, and to such
elevations they appear to resort in preference to the plains.
The number of herds in any given tract is comparatively small,
so that the animal, though generally diffused, is, nevertheless,
nowhere abundant. Its pace is a gallop, which, in appearance,
is of a heavy character, but its progress is amazingly rapid.
It is an animal extremely vigilant, and always appears to be in
fear of enemies; hence it comes seldom within the range of the
hunter’s gun.”</p>
</div>

<p>The well-known sportsman and naturalist Sir William Cornwallis Harris,
whose expedition through the interior of the Colony up to the Tropic
of Capricorn took place in 1836 and 1837, writes in his usual charming
style of this favourite object of the hunter’s pursuit<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Not less from its singular beauty than from its extreme rarity,
there were few game animals in the whole African catalogue
that I more eagerly sought for than the Roan Antelope&mdash;my
hankering after its gay spoils being moreover greatly increased
by the difficulties that I at first experienced in obtaining
possession of them. According to indications given by my kind
friend Dr. Smith, in whose cabinet I had seen this noble
and imposing Antelope, it was on an elevated tract of rocky
table-land forming a terrace on the mountains between Daniel’s
Kuil and Kramer’s Fontein, that I first disturbed a herd whilst
wandering alone in search of them along the ‘rigging’ of the
hills. The thin covering of earth supported only a scant and
faded vegetation, together with a few scrubby trees and bushes
which grew from the fissures of the rock. Surmounted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> by a
pair of jagged ibex-looking horns, the magpie-head of a sturdy
old hull, protruded above a thin copse of brushwood through
which I was riding, was not to be mistaken. I sprang from my
horse, and as the whole bloom-coloured herd arose to make its
rush, sent a bullet spinning betwixt the ribs of their gallant
leader. But, although tantalized by an occasional glimpse of
his silvery form, I followed the bloody trail over hill and
through dale for eleven long hours, desisting only when the
sun had gone down and daylight would serve me no longer, I was
finally doomed to disappointment through lack of assistance.
Not another specimen was seen until we had reached the Limpopo,
the elevated tracts lying between which river and the Likwa
divide the principal waters of Southern Africa, and form the
peculiar habitat of this species. Even there it invariably
resides in limited families, which seldom contain more than
one old bull&mdash;a dozen or more of the younger males usually
herding by themselves. Equal in stature to the largest Arab
horse, the whole structure&mdash;remarkably powerful and muscular&mdash;is
especially adapted for traversing the rugged regions that it
frequents. Not less vigilant than active, its wary troops were
ever most difficult to approach&mdash;the bare mountains crowned
with wooded terraces that form the stronghold upon which, when
disturbed, they invariably sought an asylum, proving alike
impracticable to the sportsman, whether equipped in pedestrian
or in equestrian order; and some time had elapsed before I
accidentally ascertained the species to be so utterly destitute
of <i>foot</i>&mdash;that if detected in the open glades, or among
the slightly wooded downs, to which morning and evening they
resort, the bulls especially may be ridden down upon an inferior
horse in a quarter of a mile! For this singular fact I was the
less prepared, from having previously ascertained the speed and
bottom of the true Gemsbok&mdash;an animal which is scarcely less
heavily built&mdash;to be unrivalled among the larger Antelopes.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Roan Antelope appears never to have existed south of the Orange
River, and in more recent days, we fear, has retired much further
into the interior than the localities specified by Andrew Smith and
Cornwallis Harris. Messrs. Nicolls and Eglinton, in their ‘Sportsman
in South Africa,’ tell us that it is “now very rarely found on the
upper and lower banks of the Botletle River about the Mababé Flats,
Great Makari-kari Salt-pans, and Chobe districts, while in the less
frequented portions of Matabeleland it is still fairly common, and
although once numerous in Mashonaland, is now only to be found there in
the low country towards the east coast.” Mr. Selous also states that
it is “tolerably plentiful” in parts of Mashonaland, and that he found
a good many in the Manica country, north of the Zambesi. Mr. W. L.
Sclater informs us that on the western side of South Africa it is still
to be found in plenty in Damaraland and Ovampoland.</p>

<p>In the Transvaal, Dr. Percy Rendall, writing in 1895, states that a few
of these fine animals were still to be found on the Oliphants River.
Herr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> Reiche, of Alfeld, informs us that, in his yearly importations
of animals from the Transvaal since 1887, he has received no less than
eight living examples of this Antelope, which have been disposed of to
various Continental Gardens. These, however, may have been obtained in
the adjoining Portuguese border-country to the north of that Republic.
But Mr. Kirby, in his ‘Haunts of Wild Game,’ tells us that, “although
very rare,” the Roan Antelope is still to be found in the north-eastern
parts of the Transvaal. “There are a few on the high stony ridges
across the Mehlamhali and about Maripi’s Berg and the Oliphants River,
but nowhere in large numbers.” In 1891 he shot two fine bulls on the
Nuanetsi, but they were wanderers.</p>

<p>It was across the Limpopo within the borders of Mashonaland that Mr.
John Millais came across this beautiful Antelope in 1893. Its head
forms one of the subjects of the cover of his enchanting volume ‘A
Breath from the Veldt,’ the pages of which contain several excellent
sketches of this splendid animal and much information on its habits. It
was near Eland’s Fontein, between the Rivers Bubye and Nuanetsi, that
Mr. Millais obtained his first specimen of the Roan Antelope, of which
he writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On the Veldt the Roan has a fine and noble appearance, though
it does look a bit ‘front heavy,’ It carries its head very
finely, but not with the grace and the nobility of the Sable. In
many respects it resembles its handsomer cousin. Its habits are
much the same, being found alike in open or enclosed country,
though on the whole it evinces a greater predilection for the
great plains with scattered bush, while the Sable is fond of
climbing about the low rocky hills, or in bush at the base of
kopjies. The Roan Antelope is also a much more regular drinker
than the Sable, which can go for long periods without requiring
water. A troop of the former, if undisturbed, come every evening
to about the same spot on some favourite sluit of standing
water, while the latter drink irregularly and nearly always
about daybreak.</p>

<p>“Although the Roan is a very large animal, standing about 5 feet
at the shoulder, the dull reddish grey of its hide makes it very
hard to distinguish in bush, and it would often be passed even
in the open lands but for its shy nature, which causes it to
start lumbering away as soon as it sees a man on a horse.</p>

<p>“The Sable will stand and stare at you quite close sometimes, as
much as to say ‘Who the devil are you?’ The Koodoo will creep
under the shadow of a thorn bush and hope to ‘Goodness gracious’
you won’t notice him; but the Roan will say ‘Good morning’ as
soon as he sees you.</p>

<p>“Roans seem to keep in much smaller parties than the Sables,
about a dozen cows being the limit, whilst the old males live
much to themselves, and are more difficult to find than they
are to bag. When running the Roans adopt single file, and each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
follows closely the steps and movements of the old cow who
generally leads. They have a very fair power of endurance, but
I think that any decent horse, if properly handled, will run
them to a standstill. All hunters, however, are agreed that
one should be careful in such experiments, for this Antelope
is doubtless the most dangerous of all the tribe, there being
plenty of authenticated instances of the animals turning and
charging furiously when merely pressed too hard.”</p>
</div>

<p>Again, Mr. Millais writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Dutchmen, who are generally pretty well at sea as regards
the names of wild game, have never quite made up their minds
what to call this animal. They consider that he has absolutely
no claims to legitimacy on any score, and half the members of
that nation whom you meet will christen it either ‘Bastard
Eland’ or ‘Bastard Gemsbok,’ both of which are equally
ridiculous and inappropriate. Though the animal, when viewed
critically, is on the whole imposing and even beautiful, when
seen running it looks decidedly clumsy, and wanting in both
proportion and elegance; yet the head, when well set up and
viewed among other specimens of African fauna, has a striking
and pleasing appearance. The fine blending of colours on the
face, the white switches of hair over the lachrymal glands
standing out over the black of the cheeks, the fine rough neck,
and the long queerly-shaped ears, all tend to give the head the
wild game look it certainly possesses. The horns themselves,
though nothing compared with those of the Waterbuck, Koodoos,
and Sable, are beautifully annulated, and look quite in
proportion. Ward gives the maximum of males as 33 inches, and
females 30½ inches. I would call the attention of the reader, if
a naturalist, to the very peculiar shape of the ear, and to the
way that the white whisps drop from above the lachrymal sinus,
making the hairs stand out slightly as they do in life.</p>

<p>“Of all the larger Antelope, except perhaps the Eland, the Roan
is the easiest to kill. If the hunter follows a troop up they
will frequently stop and allow several shots to be fired at
them; but the hunter must above all things keep them in good
view, for once out of sight the Roans know they are likely to be
followed up, and it will be found next to impossible to approach
them, their sense of sight and smell is so keen, and they so
commonly start running long before you have spotted them.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another recent authority on the Antelopes of Mashonaland, Mr. J.
Ffolliott Darling, F.Z.S., has kindly favoured us with the following
notes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Roan Antelopes are rather scarce over most parts of
Mashonaland. They run in small troops of from 3 to 6 or 8 in
number. They vary greatly in bulk and in size of horn; sometimes
a big bull will have a very poor head.</p>

<p>“I once came across a very trusting troop of Roans consisting
of a bull and four cows, in the morning soon after sunrise, on
an open plain; they allowed my companion to shoot the bull from
the road: we put him on a wagon and went on to camp at a stream
a few miles further on. During the day the four cows came along
and grazed with our oxen within a few hundred yards of where we
were camped. When the boy went to bring in the oxen, I went with
him and I walked up to within 75 yards of the Roans before they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
showed any signs of uneasiness; then they looked awhile, kicked
their heels in the air, and galloped off a bit and had a little
fight in play, came back again and continued playing about there
while the oxen were being inspanned.</p>

<p>“On another occasion, in November, I found a cow and calf by
themselves in the middle of the day, on an open flat. I sat
down on the top of an ant-hill to watch, and presently, after
inspecting me carefully at 800 yards distance, the cow lay down
on the top of another ant-hill, the better to keep me in view,
while the calf played about and nibbled the grass; after half an
hour or so the cow got up and they moved off leisurely to the
hills.”</p>
</div>

<p>Passing to the north of the Zambesi we have already recorded the
occurrence of the Roan Antelope on the Manica Plateau in the Barotse
country on the testimony of Mr. Selous. Herr Lorenz. in his list of
Dr. Holub’s Mammals, also catalogues a male specimen obtained by that
traveller in the same district. Further north it was found by Mr.
Alfred Sharpe to be abundant near Lake Mweru, and five heads of it
were sent home by him in 1895. Mr. Sharpe, on his journey from Lake
Nyasa to Mweru in 1892, first met with the Roan Antelope after crossing
the Saisi, which flows into Lake Rikwa (see P. Z. S. 1895, p. 723).
In the Protectorate of Nyasaland this Antelope would appear to be not
so common, and Mr. Crawshay did not include it in his list. But it
occurs, according to the late Capt. Sclater, in the Shiré Highlands on
the Tochila Plains between Blantyre and Milanji (see P. Z. S. 1895, p.
728), and Major Frank Trollope is stated to have shot specimens on the
east coast of Lake Nyasa (Johnston, Br. Centr. Afr. p. 318).</p>

<p>On the Nyasa-Tanganyika plateau between the two lakes, according to
information supplied to us by Mr. James B. Yule, the Roan is one of the
most abundant Antelopes, and is met with in herds of from 20 to 30.</p>

<p>Passing on northwards we now come to German and British Eastern Africa,
on specimens from which countries Herr Neumann has lately based his
<i>Hippotragus rufo-pallidus</i>. As already stated, we regard this
local form, so far as present evidence goes, as at most not more than
a subspecies of <i>H. equinus</i>. As regards its alleged variation
in colour, it should be recollected that an excellent observer, Mr.
Selous, tells us that these Antelopes “differ very much one from
another in colour, some being of a strawberry-roan, others of a deep
dark grey or brown, and others again so light as to appear almost white
at a distance”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>

<p>In this part of Africa the Roan Antelope appears to have been first
observed by Speke, who met with it in swampy ground near Kazeh in
Uniamwesi “in considerable numbers,” and sent home a single head. Herr
Matschie records it as observed by Böhm in Uganda. Herr Oscar Neumann
kindly informs us that during his two years’ journeyings in East Africa
he only met with one herd of this Antelope, out of which he shot five
specimens, all females. This was on the 24th of September, 1893, on
the upper River Bubu, halfway between Irangi and Mount Gurui. “When
approached, the herd did not go off at full speed, but trotted away and
then broke into a slow canter.” Herr Neumann believes he could have
shot more of them if he had not been exhausted by hard running.</p>

<p>Herr Matschie kindly furnishes us with the following additional
localities for this Antelope in German East Africa:&mdash;Upper Pangani
River, south of Kilimanjaro (<i>Kaiser</i> and <i>Schillings</i>);
between Lumbwa and Kavirondo (<i>Schillings</i>); and Ufipa in Ukonongo
(<i>Hösemann</i>).</p>

<p>In British East Africa, likewise, this Antelope appears to be local
and rather rare. Mr. Jackson believes that he saw it on the northern
slopes of Mount Elgon (Big Game Shoot, i. p. 292), and, more recently,
has recorded that Capt. F. S. Dugmore, R.N.R., shot a male on the Athi
Plains in July 1896<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. Mr. Jackson also writes to us from the Ravine
Station on the Uganda Road as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In April last, two marches from here, I saw a herd of 7
Antelopes much resembling the Roan. They were about 800
yards off, and I had a good look at them with a powerful
telescope before commencing a stalk, which, I regret to say,
was unsuccessful through one of them, that I did not notice,
seeing me. There were four cows, one bull, and two half-grown
calves. In colour they were like an Oryx, and not unlike it in
shape, though larger and longer on the leg. The back of the
neck was arched, like a Sable, and appeared to carry a short
dark zebra-like mane. The ears were very long and tufted, and
the horns of both the bull and cows were thick in proportion to
their length, the bull’s perhaps 20 inches or more, and curved
backwards like a Roan. With the exception of one calf they were
all standing under a big tree in the shade, and as they were
all broadside on to me I could not make out what the facial
markings were like. As the calf stood facing me, its ears stood
out almost at right angles to its head, with a slight droop
towards the tips. They appeared to me to be not large enough for
Roan (I have only seen those in the Natural History Museum), and
I believe that they are more likely to be <i>H. bakeri</i>. I
feel sure that they are of the same species as that I saw on the
northern slopes of Mount Elgon in 1890.” (See P. Z. S. 1897, p.
454.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span></p>

<p>Finally, on March 1st last year, Mr. W. E. de Winton at a meeting of
the Zoological Society exhibited a head-skin of this Antelope, brought
home from Machakos, on the Uganda Road, by Mr. S. L. Hinde, which had
been obtained from the Collector at that station.</p>

<p>From the slopes of Mount Elgon we will now proceed further northwards
to the swamps of the Bahr el Ghazal and the plains of the Atbara
and Blue Nile. Here we find the Roan Antelope, or at all events its
nearly allied representative, long ago recognized, and dedicated, as
a new species, to the memory of the well-known British sportsman and
traveller the late Sir Samuel Baker. Heuglin, who was the author of
the name “<i>bakeri</i>,” though well acquainted by report with this
species (which he says occurs in herds in the open districts of Galabat
and on the Atbara), tells us that he had only once seen it himself,
and had derived most of his information on it from Baker, who, in his
‘Albert Nyanza,’ vol. i. p. 340), speaking of the Latooka country on
the right bank of the White Nile, between 4° and 5° N. lat., writes as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I saw varieties of Antelopes, including the rare and beautiful
<i>Maharif</i>; but all were so wild, and the ground so open,
that I could not get a shot. This was the more annoying, as
the <i>Maharif</i> was an Antelope that I believed to be of a
new species. It had often disappointed me; for although I had
frequently seen them on the south-west frontier of Abyssinia,
I had never been able to procure one, owing to their extreme
shyness, and to the fact of their inhabiting open plains, where
stalking was impossible. I had frequently examined them with a
telescope, and had thus formed an intimate acquaintance with
their peculiarities. The <i>Maharif</i> is very similar to the
Roan Antelope of South Africa, but is mouse-coloured, with black
and white stripes upon the face. The horns are exactly those
of the Roan Antelope, very massive and corrugated, bending
backwards to the shoulders. The withers are extremely high,
which give a peculiarly heavy appearance to the shoulders,
much heightened by a large and stiff black mane like that of a
hog-maned horse. I have a pair of horns in my possession that
I obtained through the assistance of a lion, who killed the
<i>Maharif</i> while drinking near my tent; unfortunately the
skin was torn to pieces, and the horns and skull were all that
remained.”</p>
</div>

<p>The well-known scientific traveller Dr. Schweinfurth also met with this
Antelope in several localities in the course of his journeys (1868–71)
among the upper affluents of the Bahr el Ghazal, and furnishes us with
a long list of the vernacular names by which it is known among the
various native tribes of that country. In the first volume of his ’Im
Herzen von Afrika’ (p. 237) he gives a good figure of its head, and
tells us how, as he was one day deeply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span> engaged in botanizing in the
forests of Bongo, a fine full-grown specimen of this stately beast
suddenly appeared close to him, and fell a victim to two well-directed
shots, to the great joy of the accompanying natives.</p>

     <p class="p0 center sm">(From P. Z. S. 1868, p. 216.)</p>
  </div>

<p>Dr. William Junker, who visited the same district of Africa in 1882,
also met with this Antelope in Zemio’s territory upon the upper
affluents of the Welle, where he tells us (‘Travels in Africa,’ Keane’s
translation, iii. p. 144) that his hunter brought in a “Bastard”
Chamois (<i>Antilope leucophæa</i>). Of this animal a figure is given
which seems decidedly to belong to this species.</p>

<p>In 1868 Sclater gave an account before the Zoological Society of
London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> of a young male Equine Antelope of this form which he had
observed in the King of Italy’s Menagerie, and illustrated it by
exhibiting a coloured photograph of the animal, which was subsequently
reproduced in the Society’s ‘Proceedings.’ The animal had been received
from Dr. Ori, the King’s agent at Khartoum, and on its death was
deposited in the Royal Zoological Museum of Turin. Sclater’s paper
was supplemented by some field-notes on this Antelope contributed by
Sir Samuel Baker, who also sent for exhibition the fine pair of horns
of the typical specimen described by Heuglin, then in his collection.
A figure of them is likewise given in Sclater’s article in the
‘Proceedings,’ which, by the kind permission of the Society, we are
enabled to reproduce in these pages (fig. 89, p. 25).</p>

<p>On Nov. 24th, 1878, the Zoological Society of London acquired a
young male Equine Antelope from Mr. C. Hagenbeck, who stated that he
had received it along with other animals from Upper Nubia. If this
statement was correct, which there is no reason to question, this
animal was, no doubt, an example of <i>Hippotragus equinus bakeri</i>,
although it was never recognized as such. It lived in the Regent’s Park
Gardens until February 23rd, 1889.</p>

<p>There was also, about twenty years ago, an Equine Antelope, obtained
from the same source, living in the Zoological Garden at Berlin. Mr.
Clarence Bartlett has kindly lent us an excellent water-colour drawing
of this specimen taken by the late Stanley Wilson. It represents, no
doubt, the same local form of this Antelope. Mr. Hagenbeck informs
us that the Berlin specimen was also received by him in one of his
consignments from the Egyptian Sudan.</p>

<p>That a representative of the Equine Antelope is likewise found in
West Africa on the open country traversed by the Upper Gambia has
been known since Whitfield, as recorded by Gray in 1852, brought home
specimens of its head and horns. Gray did not then consider these to
indicate any difference from the Cape specimen of this species in
the British Museum. In a subsequent journey Whitfield also brought
home for the Derby Menagerie two, or perhaps three, living examples
of this Antelope. These were figured by Waterhouse Hawkins in three
water-colour drawings forming part of the two volumes of original
sketches by Waterhouse Hawkins and Wolf which are now in the Library
at Knowsley, and which, by the kind permission of the present Earl
of Derby, were exhibited and described by Sclater at the meeting of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> Zoological Society on December 15th, 1896<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. From the MS. notes
written on these three drawings we learn that they were made on board
the <span class="allsmcap">S.S.</span> ‘African’ on Sept. 11th and 12th, 1848, and represent
the adult female and young male of this Antelope&mdash;the “<i>Dacris</i>”
of Whitfield.</p>

<p>By the kind permission of Lord Derby we now give an exact copy,
slightly reduced in size, put upon the stone by Mr. Smit (Plate
LXXVIII), of Waterhouse Hawkins’s drawing of the “Dacris,” which forms
one of the figures of plate 5 of the second volume of this valuable
series, and is stated to represent an adult female. This figure will be
observed to differ from that of the male (Plate LXXVII.) in its much
lighter and more reddish colouring, and especially in the longer ears
of the Gambian animal.</p>

<p>One of the young specimens brought home by Whitfield is now stuffed in
the Derby Museum at Liverpool. As we learn from the label, it died in
London on its way to Knowsley.</p>

<p>More recently heads of this Antelope have been obtained on the Gambia
by Dr. Percy Rendall, F.Z.S., and by Sir R. B. Llewelyn, the present
Governor. The latter were exhibited by Sclater at a meeting of the
Zoological Society on May 3rd, 1898<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, when attention was called to
the large number of fine Antelopes that occur in the Gambia Colony,
and to the desirableness of procuring further information about them.
According to the notes supplied to us by Sir R. B. Llewelyn, the Roan
Antelope, which is the “<i>Da Kevoi</i>” of the Mandingos, is found in
some places in Jara and Kiaung, and is common in Eastern Niammina.</p>

<p>The horns in question are those of a not fully adult animal, measuring
26½ inches along the curvature. They do not present any noticeable
features to distinguish them from those of <i>Hippotragus equinus
typicus</i> of South Africa.</p>

<p>The existence of this Antelope in West Africa has been further
confirmed by Herr Matschie, who has included it in his list of Mammals
of the German Protectorate of Togo, on the Gulf of Guinea, where it
occurs on the uplands of the interior. Herr Matschie kindly informs
us that the Berlin Museum has received from that locality a defective
head and skin without horns from Misa-höhe, transmitted by Herr
Baumann, and two skulls of females from Bismarckburg (<i>Kling</i> and
<i>Conrad</i>). In the collection of the British Museum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> there are
also a scalp and skull of a young male of the Roan Antelope obtained
at Balaga, Beaufort Island, on the Niger, and presented by Capt. A. J.
Richardson.</p>

<p>Lastly, we may add that there is a fine young male Roan Antelope now
living in the Zoological Garden, Antwerp, which is stated to have
been received from Senegal, and, if so, would probably belong to the
subspecies now under consideration.</p>

<p>As regards the name to be used for this local form or subspecies of the
Roan Antelope a few words are necessary. Gray, in his ‘Catalogue of the
Ruminants,’ published in 1872, proposed to call it “<i>koba</i>”&mdash;no
doubt because of Whitfield’s assurances that it was the “Kob” or “Koba”
of the Jolliffs, and, as will be seen by our list of synonyms, several
subsequent authors have followed Gray’s lead. But we have already fully
discussed the question of this much-vexed name (see Vol. I. p. 60), and
have shown that it is hopeless to attempt to refer the “Koba” of Buffon
satisfactorily to any of the species with which it has been identified.
It follows that the Latin specific term “<i>koba</i>,” founded on
Buffon’s name, must also fall to the ground. Under these circumstances
we propose to designate the western form of the Roan Antelope
<i>Hippotragus equinus gambianus</i>, as being the representative of
this species in the Gambia.</p>

<p>South of Togo, along the West-African coast down to the Congo and in
the great Congo valley itself, we are not aware of the Roan Antelope
ever having been met with; nor is it likely to occur there, as the
uniform dense forest which covers these districts would be little
suited to its habits. But when we proceed further south to Mossamedes
and the interior of Angola, where the country becomes drier and more
open, the Roan Antelope is again found. Dr. Jentink mentions it in
his article on the mammals collected in Mossamedes by Mr. P. J. van
der Kellen (Notes Leyd. Mus. ix. p. 173); and Prof. J. V. Barboza du
Bocage includes it in his catalogue of the Mammals of Angola, published
in 1892, as having been received from Golungo Alto in the interior,
where, along with the Sable Antelope, it is known by the native name of
“Palanca” or “Malanca” (Jorn. Ac. Sc. Lisboa, 2, ii. p. 26). We presume
that the Angolan representative of the Roan Antelope will be found
to belong to the typical South-African form <i>Hippotragus equinus
typicus</i>.</p>

<p>The specimens of the Roan Antelope in the British Museum consist of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
mounted adult male and a young one, and the skeleton of a male, from
Mashonaland, presented by Mr. F. C. Selous (exhibited in the gallery);
an adult male presented by Sir Andrew Smith, being the specimen figured
in his ‘Illustrations,’ as above referred to; a female presented by
Lord Derby; and a skin and skull of an adult from Lake Mweru, presented
by Mr. Crawshay. There are also several pairs of horns, one of which
was received from Dr. Burchell. These specimens all belong to the
typical form.</p>

<p>Of the East-African <i>H. equinus rufo-pallidus</i> the British Museum
has only the scalp and skull from Machakos (<i>Dr. Hinde</i>) above
referred to.</p>

<p>Of <i>H. e. bakeri</i> the British Museum has two skulls (♂ et ♀) from

the specimen from the Niger presented by Capt. Richardson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span></p>

<p>This series, as is evident, is quite insufficient to solve the vexed
question as to the amount of distinctness of the four geographical
forms or subspecies, which must remain open for future investigators.</p>

<p>Our illustration of the adult male of this Antelope (Plate LXXVII.)
was put on the stone by Mr. Smit, about twenty years ago, from a
water-colour sketch by Mr. Wolf. It is now impossible to ascertain from
what specimen this sketch was taken, but it is conjectured to have been
from a skin and skull procured by Mr. Selous in S.E. Africa. At the
same time a wood-block of the head (fig. 90, p. 29) was drawn, which
shows well the essential differences between the Roan Antelope and the
Sable Antelope (see fig. 91, p. 38).</p>

<p>Size rather less than in the Roan Antelope; adult male about 52 inches
at the withers. General colour a rich glossy black, at least in adult
males, only relieved by the white of the face-markings, of the inner
surface of the ear, and of the belly. Centre line of face black,
outside which there is a white streak reaching from the bases of the
horns to the muzzle, succeeded again on the cheeks by a black band.
Lips and region of lower jaw white. Ears of ordinary length, their
tips not pencilled. Mane well developed, the hairs directed backward.
A throat-mane present. Belly and back of hams sharply defined white.
Limbs black, the inner sides of the thighs white. Whole of tail black.</p>

<p>Skull-dimensions of an adult male from Nyasaland:&mdash;Basal length 15·7
inches, greatest breadth 6·55, muzzle to orbit 11.</p>

<p>Horns much longer than in <i>H. equinus</i>, compressed laterally,
their longitudinal much greater than their transverse diameter, heavily
ringed, boldly curved backward. In length they are often 43 or 44
inches long round the front curve, the record being 46 inches.</p>

<p><i>Female.</i> Similar to the male, but more or less brownish in
colour; horns (just as in <i>H. equinus</i>) more slender and smooth,
less curved, and rather shorter than in the male.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Hab.</i> Eastern Africa, from the Northern Transvaal to
German East Africa.</p>
</div>

<p>The distinguished traveller and sportsman Sir William Cornwallis Harris
whose works we have so often quoted in these pages, was the discoverer
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span> this Antelope, which was characterized by Gordon-Cuming&mdash;the great
African hunter&mdash;as “one of the loveliest animals which graces this fair
creation.” Harris writes in one of his works that “the desire nearest
to his heart” from the beginning of his journey had been to “discover
something new”; and in the present instance he certainly succeeded. But
we will let him tell his story in his own words.</p>

<p>When encamped on the Cashan Mountains in what is now the north-western
part of the Transvaal, in 1836, as he writes in his volume on ‘Wild
Sports in Southern Africa,’ he achieved his success as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My doubled-barrelled rifle having again suffered in a fall
with my horse, I took the field on the 13th December with a
heavy weapon constructed upon the primitive principle of flint
and steel, which, as a <i>pis-aller</i>, I had obtained at the
Kuruman.</p>

<p>“Our party were in full pursuit of a wounded elephant,
when a herd of unusually dark-looking antelopes attracted
observation in an adjacent valley. Reconnoitring them through
a pocket-telescope from the acclivity on which we stood, I
at once exclaimed that they were new; and having announced
my intention of pursuing them, if requisite, to the world’s
end, I dashed down the slope, followed by the derision of the
Hottentots, for my unsportsman-like attention to an ‘ugly buck,’
<i>one</i> specimen of which, however, I assured them I would
rather possess than all the elephants in Africa! In an instant
I was in the middle of the herd, which was then crossing the
valley&mdash;nine chestnut-coloured does leading, and two magnificent
coal-black bucks&mdash;all with scimitar-shaped horns&mdash;bringing up
the rear. Hastily dismounting, I was delighted to observe them
stand for a few seconds within fifty yards, and stare at me with
amazement. In vain was it, however, that I pulled the trigger of
my rifle; three several times the heavy machinery of the lock
descended with alarming vehemence, but no report followed the
concussion; and the herd having in the meantime ascended a steep
hill, I fairly rode my horse to a standstill in the attempt to
overtake them. Cursing my hard fortune as I dashed the hateful
weapon to the ground, I hastened to the camp to repair my rifle;
armed with which, and mounted on a fresh steed, I returned with
my companion to the spot, where, having taken up the footmarks,
we followed them, with unwearied perseverance, among the
hills, during the whole of that and the following day, without
attaining even a glimpse of the objects of our quest. At noon
of the third day, however, peeping cautiously over a bank, our
laudable assiduity was rewarded by the gratifying sight of the
two bucks grazing by themselves, unconscious of our approach, in
a stony valley.</p>

<p>“Having disposed our forces, after a moment’s consultation, so
as to intercept the game from a tangled labyrinth of ravines,
the attack was made. The hind leg of the handsomer of the two
was dangling in an instant, and in another he was sprawling on
the earth. Quickly recovering himself, however, he led me more
than a mile over the sharp stones ere he was brought to bay,
when, twice charging gallantly, he was at length overthrown and
slain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<p>“It were vain to attempt a description of the sensations I
experienced when thus, after three days of toilsome tacking
and feverish anxiety, unalleviated by any incident that could
inspire the smallest hope of ultimate success, I at length found
myself in actual possession of so brilliant an addition to the
riches of natural history. The prize evidently belonged to the
Aigocerine group, and was equal in stature to a large galloway.
The horns, which were flat, and upwards of three feet in length,
swept gracefully over the back in the form of a crescent. A
bushy black mane extended from the lively chestnut-coloured
ears to the middle of the back; the tail was long and tufted;
and the glossy jet-black hue of the greater portion of the
body contrasted beautifully with a snow-white face and belly.
We thought we could never have looked at or admired it
sufficiently; my companion observing, after a long pause, ‘that
the Sable Antelope would doubtless become the admiration of
the world,’ A drawing and description having been completed on
the spot, the skin was carefully removed and conveyed upon a
pack-horse in triumph to the camp; and it may possibly interest
those of my readers, who shall have followed me during the last
three days, to learn that I succeeded, with infinite difficulty,
in bringing this unique and interesting specimen of African
zoology, in a state of high preservation, to Cape Town, where,
in October last, it was elegantly set up by Monsieur Verreaux,
the French naturalist, and obligingly taken to England by my
well-known friend Captain Alexander, 42nd Royal Highlanders, and
is now in the British Museum.”</p>
</div>

<p>On January 9th, 1838, Harris exhibited his mounted specimen of the
Sable Antelope at a meeting of the Zoological Society of London, and
proposed for it the apposite scientific name “<i>niger</i>.” The same
specimen was subsequently figured in the second volume of the Society’s
‘Transactions.’</p>

<p>Writing in 1881 Mr. Selous gave the following account of the
distribution of the Sable Antelope at that period:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At the present a few Sable Antelopes are still to be found
in south-western. Matabele Land, in the neighbourhood of the
Ramokwebani, Shashani, and Samookwe rivers (tributaries of the
Shashe). Along the waggon-road leading from Tati to the Zambesi
it may be met with here and there, but is decidedly scarce. All
along the Chobe river, as far as I have been, I have met with
this Antelope, though sparingly. In the Mābābe country,
and on the road leading from there to Bamangwato, I neither
saw a Sable Antelope nor the spoor of one, and do not think
its range extends so far to the west. In the broken country to
the south of the Victoria Falls, in the neighbourhood of the
Pendamatenka and Daka rivers, it is not uncommon, but its true
home is the higher portions of the Mashuna country, to the
north-east of the Matabele country. There it is the commonest
Antelope, and may still be met with in herds of over fifty
individuals, the usual number being from ten to twenty. However
large the herd, I have never seen more than one full-grown bull
with it, though there may be several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span> half-grown ones; whilst
in a large herd of any other kind of Antelopes two or more
full-grown males are nearly always to be seen. On the Manica
plateau, north of the Zambesi, Sable Antelopes are also to be
met with. The longest pair of male Sable Antelope’s horns I have
seen measured 45 inches over the curve, the longest pair of
female 33 inches. In the Mashuna country and along the Chobe the
average length of the horns of these animals is greater than in
south-western Matabele Land.”</p>
</div>

<p>In his admirable work entitled ‘A Breath from the Veldt’ Mr. John
Millais has devoted many pages and sketches to the illustration of this
splendid creature, which he evidently places as the finest of all the
Antelopes of South Africa. He describes it as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In general appearance and sporting qualities the Sable Antelope
(<i>Hippotragus niger</i>) yields the palm to none of its kind.
There is about the whole animal that indescribable charm that
is so intensely African and associated with the wild life. Its
strong individuality must ever stand out in the minds of those
who have been so fortunate as to see and shoot it, and it is
certainly one of the chief objects of interest in the splendid
fauna of that country. Apart from its satin-like hide, sweeping
horns, erect mane, and great strength, the Sable Antelope
presents an appearance of fearlessness and nobility that is very
striking, to say the least of it. Though the Koodoo surpasses
his rival in elegance and general appearance when dead, he is
but a skulker, and makes but a poor show beside the Sable on the
Veldt. I would say, if such a comparison be allowable, the two
hold their own like the rival beauties of a London drawing-room.
The fair beauty sits quietly in a corner, charming her immediate
circle with her graceful shyness and beauty, and people take sly
glances at her from the other end of the room, while pretending
to devote their attention to someone else. What a contrast with
her black-eyed rival, who flaunts into the room as if she owned
the entire show, and commands the attention of all eyes by her
flashy and striking beauty! The one attracts attention slowly,
the other commands it at once. Roughly speaking, the height of
this grand Antelope at the shoulder is about 4½ feet, but he
looks much taller, owing to his great shoulders and unusually
thick neck, ornamented with its erect crest of hair. The tail is
long, and has a good wisp of hair at the end, which, like the
tails of the Roan Antelope and the Waterbuck, swings from side
to side as the animal gallops away. Like the Koodoo, the horns
of the Sable are its chief glory, and the noble manner in which
the head is carried by the buck when on the move is a splendid
thing to see. Unlike all Deer, and nearly all Antelope, the
Sable when running arches the neck instead or raising the chin;
this gives the animal its nice picture-booky look, and I could
hardly imagine a finer subject for an animal painter than a herd
of these grand beasts on the move, if their heads and necks be
properly drawn.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. F. V. Kirby, F.Z.S., in his ‘Haunts of Wild Game,’ also devotes
a whole chapter to an account of his rencontres with this Antelope,
which he found “by no means rare” in his favourite hunting-grounds in
the Lydenburg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> district of the Transvaal, and gives several excellent
illustrations of its noble form.</p>

<p>Lastly, Mr. J. Ffolliott Darling, F.Z.S., has kindly favoured us with
the following field-notes on this Antelope as lately observed by him in
Mashonaland and Matabeleland:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These Antelopes, of which the Mashona names are
<i>Inguarāti</i> and <i>Marabālla</i>, were much more numerous
before the incursion of the Pioneers in 1890, but even now, in
most out-of-the-way places, they are abundant, especially on the
higher parts of the plateau, which is from 3000 to 5000 feet
high. As late as 1896 I have seen troops of these bucks lying
out on the open flats at midday, far from any cover, but, as a
rule, when much disturbed and hunted, they seek concealment in
the bush for their daily sleep. They usually go in troops of
from 5 to 12 or 15, the largest herd I ever counted consisting
of 22 individuals; I often heard of troops of 50 or 60, but when
an opportunity offered of counting them they invariably resolved
themselves into a score or so. Occasionally one comes across a
bull keeping altogether by himself, and in such cases I always
found him very wary and almost impossible to approach within
shot. Whatever may be the reason for his going alone, it is
evidently the same cause that has also made him very suspicious
and cautious. I have known a lone bull haunt a certain spot for
months, and have seen him frequently, but never in company.
Sometimes 3 or 4 bulls will be found together, but usually herds
are mixed&mdash;young and old, male and female, run together; a troop
of 10 will consist of one big bull, 3 or 4 younger males, and
the remainder cows or young ones. The old bulls don’t seem to
wish to drive away the younger males, as Deer do.</p>

<p>“One day, as I was quietly meandering through the bush in
Mashonaland, a troop of 10 or 12 Sable came trotting by. About
half had gone past me without suspicion, when a cow took the
alarm, and, stopping suddenly, looked in my direction. She could
not exactly make out the enemy, but after a few seconds she
stamped her foot two or three times and snorted, as if to warn
the others to keep quiet. They all stopped, gazing about, but
finally cantered off without having satisfied their curiosity.</p>

<p>“These Antelopes fight very well with their long curved horns,
and strike sideways very quickly. A dog that is unwise enough to
run up behind and try to lay hold of one has little chance of
escaping impalement. A bull won’t run very far from a dog, but
will stop to fight him, and if the dog keeps out of his reach
and stays running round and barking at him the hunter can easily
get up for a shot.</p>

<p>“When taken young, Sables get very tame and bold, and will push
open the door and demolish a loaf of bread or any other eatables
that may be handy. A young bull used to frequent the laager at
Salisbury during the Mashonaland rebellion in 1896; he was very
friendly with white folks, but&mdash;unlike some of the stay-at-home
philanthropists&mdash;knew the difference between white and black men
very well, and if a ‘black brother’ took any liberties with him
he was promptly knocked down.</p>

<p>“The Sable calves are mostly born in November and December
(spring and early summer), but I have shot cows heavy with young
at the same time that others had good-sized calves.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span></p>

<p>Passing northwards of the Zambesi we find the Sable Antelope recorded
by Peters, in his ‘Reise nach Mossambique,’ as met with in the
Portuguese dominions west of Tette, and on the woody plains of Sena.
In Nyasaland Mr. Crawshay tells us it is not by any means evenly
distributed, but appears to be plentiful in some places. In the Shiré
Highlands, as Sir Harry Johnston writes, the Sable is one of the
commonest Antelopes, frequenting the wooded hills rather than the
low-lying plains, and we have seen many heads obtained by Mr. Sharpe,
the late Capt. Sclater, and others from this district.</p>

<p>Sir Harry Johnston believes that the Sable Antelope is also found on
the Nyasa-Tanganyika plateau; but it has not, so far as we are aware,
been obtained there by Mr. Sharpe, Mr. Crawshay, Mr. Yule, and others
who have traversed that district. It, however, certainly occurs again
further north in the coast-district of German East Africa. Herr Oscar
Neumann informs us that during his journey through German and British
East Africa he never saw a specimen of <i>H. niger</i> alive, but only
the skin of one that had been killed near Tanga on the coast. His
opinion is that the species is not now to be met with anywhere in the
interior of German East Africa, but that there are still some herds of
it left on the coast opposite Zanzibar, near Tanga and Pangani. In this
district it was formerly hunted by Sir John Kirk, in whose collection
there is a head of the Sable Antelope, which has been examined by
Sclater. The specimen, as Sir John kindly informs us, was obtained
about twelve miles inland, somewhat to the north of the River Wami, in
the winter of 1884–5.</p>

<p>Whether the Sable Antelope occurs much further north than this seems
to be by no means certain. Sir Harry Johnston has enumerated it among
the Antelopes of the Kilimanjaro district (Kilimanjaro Exp. p. 354).
Sir John Willoughby had a shot at what “<i>he believed</i> was a herd
of ‘Sable Antelopes’” on his journey from Mombasa into the interior
in 1886 (East Africa, pp. 46, 47), but did not secure a specimen. Mr.
Jackson and Mr. Gedge “<i>saw</i> a herd of about ten or twelve near
Gulu Gulu in November 1888,” but Mr. Jackson admits that no European
has yet bagged a Sable Antelope in British East Africa.</p>

<p>There is also no good authority for the occurrence of the Sable
Antelope still further north on the White Nile, although it is included
in Heuglin’s List of N.E. African Mammals as being met with in the
Shilluk country on the authority of v. Pruyssenaer. We may therefore,
for the present, draw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> the northern limit of the Sable Antelope on the
east side of Africa at somewhere about the 5th degree N. lat. On the
western side of Africa the Sable Antelope, which Mr. Selous has already
shown to occur on the Manica Plateau in Barotseland, appears to extend
thence into Southern Angola, where, according to Prof. Barboza du
Bocage, Welwitsch obtained it in Mossamedes<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>

  </div>

<p>Many living specimens of the Sable Antelope have been brought to Europe
of late years. The first example, a male, reached our Zoological
Society’s Gardens in 1861, and a second male in 1873. In 1895 a fine
young pair were purchased of Mr. C. Reiche, of Alfeld, along with the
young female Giraffe which arrived in February of that year. They have
done well and are still thriving, but have not yet bred.</p>

<p>At the Zoological Gardens of Hamburg they have been more fortunate
with this species, a fine calf having been born there on the 1st
of May, 1894. Of this interesting animal we are able to give an
illustration (Plate LXXX.) through the kindness of the Director, Dr.
Bolau, who has sent Sclater an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> excellent water-colour drawing of the
mother and young, executed by the well-known German zoological artist
Leutemann, when the young one was rather more than a fortnight old.
Other Continental gardens have also now, or have lately had, living
representatives of this beautiful species. In the Cologne Gardens, as
Dr. Wunderlich kindly informs us, this Antelope has bred twice&mdash;in
April 1896, when the period of gestation was observed to be 272 days,
and in March 1898, when it was reckoned at 281 days.</p>

<p>Our illustration of the male of this Antelope (Plate LXXIX.) was put
on the stone by Mr. Smit, under the direction of the late Sir Victor
Brooke, about twenty years ago, from a water-colour sketch prepared by
Mr. Wolf, but we have not been able to ascertain from what specimen it
was taken. Mr. Smit at the same time prepared a wood-block of the head
(fig. 91, p. 38), which he believes was taken from a specimen lent to
Sir Victor by Mr. Selous.</p>

<p>Besides Harris’s original type specimen to which we have already called
attention, there are mounted examples of both sexes of this Antelope
and a mounted skeleton in the British Museum received from Mr. Selous,
who procured them in Mashonaland. There are also in the National
Collection a skin of an adult female from Caffreland (<i>Wahlberg</i>),
three skins from Nyasaland presented by Sir Harry Johnston, and a skin
from Lake Mweru presented by Mr. Alfred Sharpe, besides several skulls
and pairs of horns from different localities.</p>

<p>Size medium or large. Tail with a long and thick terminal tuft. Hairs
along the neck and spine with their points projecting towards the head,
the parting being situated on the rump or behind the middle of the back.</p>

<p>Skull with small lachrymal vacuities and of the same general structure
as in <i>Hippotragus</i>; but the bases of the horns, instead of rising
vertically above the eyes and forming an elevated forehead as in that
genus, project straight backwards, continuing the line of the face and
lying in the same plane as the nasal bones.</p>

<p>Horns long, cylindrical, slender, straight, or with a gradual and
gentle backward curvature, diverging at a very acute angle; ribbed in
their basal half.</p>

<p><i>Female</i> with horns as in the male.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Range of the Genus.</i> Africa south of the Sahara, except in
the west-coast woodland and Congo Basin; also Southern Arabia.</p>
</div>

<p>The five species of the genus here recognized may be arranged as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="smaller">
  <li class="hangingindent"><i>a.</i> Horns, when fully developed, crescentically recurved

nearly uniform brown colour both outside and inside; body of a
nearly uniform dirty white; no black spinal stripe, and only a
faint throat-stripe; tips and edges of ears white; nearly the
whole of the cheek beneath the eye covered with a large brown
or blackish patch continuous with the ocular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span> stripe; at most
a faint brown stripe passing along the side above the belly;
tail-tuft white at the base.&emsp;&emsp;114. <i>O. beatrix.</i></li>
  <li class="i1 hangingindent1"><i>b<sup>1</sup>.</i> Size larger (height about 4 ft. at the withers).
Colour of legs below knees and hocks pale dirty white, and
lighter in tint than the body, though often patched with black
in front; body and neck of a nearly uniform tawny hue, with a
dark spinal stripe and a deep black throat-stripe; tips and
adjacent edges of ears black; cheek below the eye of the same
colour as the neck, bounded in front by the black ocular stripe
and behind by a similar stripe running from near the base of
the ear; a deep black stripe running along the side above the
whitish belly; tail-tuft black.</li>
  <li class="i2 hangingindent2"><i>a<sup>2</sup>.</i> Hairs on throat long, frequently forming a median
tuft or beard; nasal patch black, united on both sides with the
lower end of the ocular stripe and passing beneath the jaw, so
as to form a complete black ring round the white muzzle; a black
stripe above the knee on the fore leg, extending on the outer
side almost to the shoulder; a large black patch on the rump; a
black stripe above the belly on both sides continued on to the
thigh, and there united with a large patch of the same colour,
which covers the hind leg, both outside and inside, almost
down to the hocks; a black patch or stripe on the front of the
cannon-bone of the hind leg.&emsp;&emsp;115. <i>O. gazella.</i></li>
  <li class="i2 hangingindent2"><i>b<sup>2</sup>.</i> Hairs on throat short, not forming a tuft or beard;
nasal patch not meeting the ocular stripe, so that the muzzle is
not circumscribed by a continuous black band; black stripe above
the knee on the fore leg only extending about halfway up to the
shoulder; hind-quarters of a nearly uniform tawny tint, without
any black patches on the rump or thighs; lateral stripe above
the belly not passing on to the thigh; hind legs without any
black bands or stripes.</li>

<p>Whatever the <i>Oryx</i> of Aristotle, Pliny, and other ancient writers
may have been (which has been a subject of much discussion), there can
be little doubt that the <i>Oryx</i> of Oppian, commemorated in his
celebrated poem on the Chase, was based on an Antelope of this group.
In the Latin translation of Oppian’s work it is described as a beast
much dreaded by its fellow creatures:&mdash;</p>

<p>The classical term “<i>Oryx</i>” was first introduced into scientific
literature by Pallas in his memoir on the genus <i>Antilope</i>
published in 1767. But here he grossly misapplied the term
“<i>Oryx</i>” to the Eland, which he called <i>Antilope oryx</i>. In
his second memoir on the same subject, however (1777), Pallas corrected
this unfortunate error, and transferred <i>Oryx</i> to the Gemsbok of
the Cape, to which it was certainly much better applicable.</p>

<p>In 1816 De Blainville, when subdividing the Antelopes, first adopted
<i>Oryx</i> as a generic term, and made the <i>Antilope oryx</i> of
Pallas (that is, <i>Oryx gazella</i>) its type. The generic name of
the present species was thus settled, but before we can arrive at its
proper specific name some further explanation is necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span></p>

<p>By modern authorities, almost without exception, the present Antelope
has been called the “Leucoryx, <i>Oryx leucoryx</i>,” and it is well
known by this name in the Museums and Zoological Gardens of Europe.
But when we proceed to investigate the strict claims of the present
animal to this title, a difficult question presents itself. The
<i>Antilope leucoryx</i> of Pallas in all probability, and certainly
the <i>Antilope leucoryx</i> of succeeding authors until about 1827,
was not the present species, but, as will be clearly shown in our next
article, the Beatrix.</p>

<p>Buffon, in his ‘Histoire Naturelle,’ called the present species
“<i>l’Algazel</i>,” and Pallas and his followers named it <i>Antelope
gazella</i>. But the term “<i>gazella</i>,” as we shall presently show,
had been previously appropriated by Linnæus to the allied Gemsbok of
Southern Africa. The fact is that most of the early authors had no
clear ideas as to the distinctive characters of the present animal,
and habitually confounded it both with the Beatrix of Arabia and the
Gemsbok of the Cape.</p>

<p>The earliest travellers of modern days to meet with the Leucoryx in
its native wilds and to transmit perfect specimens of it home to
Europe were the well-known German naturalists Hemprich and Ehrenberg,
who explored Nubia, Arabia, and the adjoining countries from 1820 to
1825. Unfortunately Lichtenstein, who first described and figured
their specimens of this Antelope about the year 1827, chose to
identify it with the <i>Antilope leucoryx</i> of Pallas and to employ
Pallas’s name for it. In the ‘Symbolæ Physicæ,’ in which Hemprich and
Ehrenberg’s own account of their expedition was given to the world in
1828, Lichtenstein’s example of using <i>Antilope leucoryx</i> as the
scientific name of the present species was followed.</p>

<p>Hemprich and Ehrenberg state that they had originally intended to
have called this species <i>Antilope ensicornis</i>, but that they
eventually gave up their proposed designation for the term adopted by
Lichtenstein. The same was the case also with nearly all the leading
authorities subsequent to Lichtenstein, so that to attempt to restore
the name “<i>leucoryx</i>” to what is probably its proper owner would
now only create confusion. We prefer therefore to designate the
present species as <i>Oryx leucoryx</i> (Licht.), to which name it is
undoubtedly entitled.</p>

<p>After giving an accurate description of the present animal, and figures
of the two specimens brought home, which, although of not first-rate
quality, are perfectly recognizable, Hemprich and Ehrenberg inform us
that they met with it in Dongola, between Ambukol on the Upper Nile and
Simrie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> near Chor-el-Lebben, where they hunted it along with the Arabs
on horseback.</p>

<p>In Dongola and Kordofan, they proceed to tell us, this Antelope is
met with in herds in the deserts. Its flesh is much appreciated by
the Arabs, and is dried and laid by for future use, being likewise
often sold in the markets. Its skins are used for shields and sandals,
but are not considered of first-rate quality for these purposes.
The Arabs of the Kubabish tribe, they inform us, call this Antelope
“<i>Abu-harb</i>,” and state that it lives chiefly on the leaves and
twigs of the acacias (<i>Acacia textilis</i> and <i>A. ehrenbergi</i>)
which are found in the valleys of the desert in this district.</p>

<p>The next great explorer of North-eastern Africa, Rüppell, does not
add much to our knowledge of the present species, which, in his list
of Antelopes in the ‘Neue Wirbelthiere,’ he tells us, lives in herds
in the deserts of Nubia and also in Egypt proper, as far north as
the borders of the Fayoum. He comments, however, upon its confusion
by Lichtenstein with the <i>A. leucoryx</i> of Pallas, and calls it
<i>Antilope algazella</i>, after Buffon.</p>

<p>Our third leading authority on North-African mammals, Theodor von
Heuglin, informs us that the Leucoryx was only met with by him in
Southern Nubia and Kordofan, and in the oasis of El-Kāb, west of
Dongola. But, according to the Central-African traveller Nachtigal,
the range of this species extends into Borgu and Tibeste, while Barth
in 1850 met with it in the hills of Air or Asben, north of Agades, in
about 19° N. lat. and 9° E. long.</p>

<p>Proceeding still further westward, we may state that there can be
little doubt that the Leucoryx was formerly met with in the southern
part of Tunisia, although at the present epoch it seems to be nearly,
if not quite, extinct in the Beylik. When Sclater was in Tunis in 1898
he observed a stuffed specimen of a young Leucoryx Antelope in the
palace of the Bey at Marsa, and was told that it had been originally
received alive from the southern frontiers of Tunisia (see P.Z.S. 1898,
p. 280).</p>

<p>In the Musée Alaoui, at the Bardo Palace, Tunis, Sclater was also shown
an unmistakable figure of a Leucoryx attacked by a Lion, represented on
a piece of Roman mosaic pavement. Of this figure Sir Harry Johnston has
kindly furnished us with the accompanying sketch (fig. 92, p. 48).</p>

<p>The mosaic pavement in question, which was discovered among the remains
of a Roman villa in the vicinity of Tunis, contains representations of
various animals of the chase found in that district in Roman times.
The <i>Gætulus Oryx</i> of Juvenal (Sat. xi. 140) was therefore in all
probability the Leucoryx.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>

<p>We are not aware of any authentic records of the occurrence of the
Leucoryx on the southern frontiers of Algeria and Morocco, where,
in recent times, it has probably been driven far into the interior.
But when we go on as far west as Senegal and Nigeria it would appear
that the Leucoryx, or a form so closely allied to it as to be barely
distinguishable, is still abundant in the Senegambian deserts, and is
also, according to Capt. Mockler-Ferryman, met with on the Nile in the
vicinity of Lokoja.</p>

  </div>

<p>The first specimen of the Leucoryx received from Senegal was, so far
as we know, that figured by Geoffroy St.-Hilaire and F. Cuvier in 1819
in the ‘Histoire Naturelle des Mammifères’ (plate 376), which was then
living in the Jardin des Plantes. This, we are told, was an adult male,
standing about four feet high to the top of its head, and having long
and well-developed horns.</p>

<p>When the thirteenth Earl of Derby formed his great menagerie at
Knowsley between 1835 and 1850, the group of the Leucoryx Antelopes was
one of the specialities of the collection. The adult male and female
were figured by Waterhouse Hawkins in plate xvii. of the ‘Gleanings,’
and the young one, born at Knowsley, forms one of the figures in plate
xvi. of the same work.</p>

<p>Lord Derby obtained his first female Leucoryx in 1837, but it was not
until the retirement of Mr. Cross from the Surrey Zoological Gardens
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> the consequent dispersal of that collection, some six or seven
years afterwards, that he succeeded in acquiring a male. Owing to the
age of the female at that time, although she bred twice with the male
she failed to rear her offspring, and died in 1846, being then, as
Lord Derby believed, the only female of this species in England. When
the Derby Menagerie was dispersed in August 1851, the pair of Leucoryx
Antelopes were among the animals selected by the Zoological Society
of London, in virtue of Lord Derby’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> bequest to them, and became the
foundation of a stock which flourished for many years in the Regent’s
Park Gardens. Young ones were bred of this pair or of their descendants
in 1852, 1853, 1860, and 1864. Fresh examples of the Leucoryx were
obtained by the Society in 1870 and 1880, and in 1881 a fine female was
brought home and presented to the Menagerie by the late Mr. John M.
Cook, F.Z.S.</p>

<p>This Antelope has not done so well in the Regent’s Park of late
years, but there is still one example of it living in the Menagerie,
obtained last year, and it is hoped that a breeding pair may soon be
re-established. An excellent figure of the adults of both sexes of
the Leucoryx Antelope, drawn by Wolf from the Zoological Society’s
specimens, was published in the first volume of Wolf and Sclater’s
‘Zoological Sketches.’ In the second volume of the same work a young
one, likewise drawn by the same skilful artist, is represented on plate
xix. The calf in question was born in 1851, and was about six months
old when Mr. Wolfs water-colour drawing (from which fig. 93, p. 49, has
been taken) was prepared.</p>

<p>Lord Derby’s stock of the Leucoryx is said to have been received from
Nubia, while others in the Zoological Society’s Gardens came from
Senegal.</p>

<p>We have not been able to recognize any difference between animals from
these two countries, although they have been separated as distinct
local forms (<i>nubica</i> and <i>senegalensis</i>) by Wagner, and more
recently by Herr Matschie as different species.</p>

<p>There are at present no complete specimens of this Antelope in the
British Museum, and skins of it fit for mounting both from Dongola and
from Senegal are much required, in order that a strict comparison of
examples from these widely distant localities may be made. The series
now in the National Collection consists only of a mounted skeleton
formerly in the Zoological Society’s Museum, a skin and skull of a
young one from Sennaar, and some skulls and horns.</p>

<p>Our Plate of this Antelope (Plate LXXXI.), which represents both sexes,
was drawn on stone by Mr. Smit from a sketch prepared by Mr. Wolf,
and probably represents the same animals as the plate in ‘Zoological
Sketches’ above referred to.</p>

<p>Height at withers about 35 inches. Prevailing colour of body, neck, and
head a dirty white, slightly darker on the haunches. On the face the
frontal and nasal patches are brown in colour and sometimes separated
from each other; the brown stripe that passes from the eye unites
with the stripe that arises near the base of the ear to form on the
cheek a large patch which extends below the jaw and joins across the
inter-ramal area with the corresponding patch of the opposite side;
from this patch a narrow brown stripe runs along the throat, and is
traceable as far as the chest, which is also brown. Ears whitish; the
tip and edges not black or brown. Mane on neck whitish like the rest
of the body, and there is no median dorsal black stripe. Tail white;
the tuft black at the end. Fore leg from the shoulder, and hind leg
from the thigh, deep brown, both on the outer and inner side down to
the fetlocks; pasterns white. A faint brown longitudinal stripe is
traceable on each side between the belly and the flanks. Hair along
spine reversed from rump.</p>

<p>Horns long, straight, attaining a length of about 25 inches; ribbed for
about two-thirds of their length; the ribs small and close-set.</p>

<p><i>Female.</i> Similar to the male, and horns equally long or longer.</p>

</div>

<p>As we have already pointed out, it is highly probable, if not certain,
that the <i>Antilope leucoryx</i> of Pallas and his immediate
successors was the present species and not the preceding, which,
however, is now universally known as “The Leucoryx.” In the description
of his <i>Antilope leucoryx</i> (which forms the sixteenth species
in his second memoir on the genus <i>Antilope</i> published in 1777)
Pallas affords us so little information that not much can be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> of
it. He gives “Arabia, and perhaps Libya,” as its locality, and adds
references to the passage in the ‘Cynegetica’ of Oppian which we have
already quoted, and to “<i>Gazellæ Indicæ cornu singulare</i>”&mdash;a
“curious horn of an Indian Gazelle” which he had described in a former
memoir on some fossil bones from Siberia. On referring to this memoir,
and to the figure by which it is accompanied, we cannot say that we
are by any means satisfied that the “curious horn” in question, which
is remarkable for its length and slenderness (33 inches long, as given
by Pallas) and for its numerous annulations, belonged to the present
species. We will, however, go so far as to allow that it may possibly
have done so. At any rate we must admit that it could hardly have been
a horn of the Antelope which we now call the Leucoryx.</p>

<p>The second original authority to describe the present species was our
countryman Pennant in his ‘History of Quadrupeds,’ where he gives
the “Leucoryx” as the fifth species of his genus “Antelope.” Pennant
based his Leucoryx mainly upon “two drawings of animals in the British
Museum, taken from life in 1712 by order of Sir John Lock, Agent of
the East India Company at Ispahan; they were preserved as rarities by
the Shah of Persia in a park eight leagues from the capital.” Pennant
informs us that he had copied his description of these animals from a
paper accompanying the drawings. This species, he tells us, inhabits
“Gaw Behrein, an island in the Gulf of Bassorah,” meaning, no doubt,
what we now call Bahrein Island in the Persian Gulf. Judging from the
description and locality it would appear that Pennant’s “Leucoryx”
of 1781 was intended for the present Antelope, but the figure in the
edition of Pennant’s work of 1793, it must be allowed, gives one rather
the idea of a Beisa (<i>Oryx beisa</i>).</p>

<p>As regards the other authors which we have quoted above as following
Pallas in calling this animal <i>Antilope leucoryx</i>, it is not
necessary to take much trouble about them. They merely repeat the
stories of their predecessors without adding anything original
thereto, and seem to have had no true ideas of the distinctness of
the present species from its allies. It was not, in fact, until 1857
that the present Antelope became properly known to science in Europe
by the receipt of living specimens. The first of these was brought
from Bombay to England in that year and presented to the Zoological
Society of London by Capt. John Shepherd. This animal, which was at
first supposed to be a half-grown specimen of the Gemsbok of the Cape,
quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> attracted the notice of the late Dr. J. E. Gray, of the
British Museum, who had a capital eye for strange mammals of all sorts.
Dr. Gray immediately recognized it as belonging to a species unknown
to him, and, having apparently no suspicion that it was possibly the
veritable “Leucoryx” of the older authors, described it as new at a
Scientific Meeting of the Zoological Society held on June 23rd of
that year, at which Sclater (then recently elected a member of the
Council) well recollects having been himself present, and proposed to
call it <i>Oryx beatrix</i>, after H.R.H. The Princess Beatrice. Dr.
Gray’s description, published in the ‘Proceedings,’ is accompanied by
an excellent coloured figure of the Beatrix Antelope drawn by Wolf.
Dr. Gray conjectured that the specimen had been brought to Bombay from
the shores of the Red Sea, but it is more probable that it was carried
there from the Persian Gulf. The typical specimen, which died shortly
afterwards, was deposited in the British Museum.</p>

<p>In March 1872 a second specimen of the Beatrix Antelope was received by
the Zoological Society, and fortunately with sufficient information to
solve the enigma as to its real <i>patria</i>. It was the survivor of a
pair of these animals, obtained for the late Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, F.Z.S.,
by Col. Pelly, then British Resident at Bushire on the Persian Gulf. In
1878 a third living specimen of this Antelope, a male, was received by
the Zoological Society; this was presented by Commander F. M. Burke,
of the B.I.S.N.S.S. ‘Arcot,’ by whom it had been obtained at Jeddah in
the Red Sea from a friend who had received it as a present from the
Shereif of Mecca. It was stated to have been originally captured in the
neighbourhood of Tyeff or Tayf, in the Hedjaz Passes, some 150 miles
east of the Red Sea. In 1881 two additional specimens of the Beatrix
Antelope were presented to the same Society by the late Lord Lilford,
and since that date three other examples of the same animal have been
received alive by the Zoological Society. These were a pair presented
by Col. E. C. Ross, C.S.I., H.B.M. Consul at Bushire, in 1890, and a
single female presented by Lt.-Col. Talbot in 1892.</p>

<p>The typical specimen of <i>Oryx beatrix</i>, as already mentioned, is
in the collection of the British Museum, as is also the adult female
transmitted to the Zoological Society by Col. Pelly. Besides these, the
National Collection possesses a skeleton of a young female obtained
on the Persian Gulf by Mr. B. T. ffinch, F.Z.S., and some skins and
skulls collected in Muscat by Dr. A. S. G. Jayakar, C.M.Z.S. Specimens
of the Beatrix Antelope are,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> however, excessively rare in European
collections, and we are not aware that any of the continental museums
have succeeded in obtaining specimens of it.</p>

<p>From what has been stated it is evident that the range of the Beatrix
Antelope reaches from the shores of the Red Sea across Southern Arabia
to Muscat. How far up the coast of the Persian Gulf it extends is
uncertain, but the specimens stated by Pennant to have been brought to
Ispahan from the Bahrein Islands had probably been obtained from the
opposite mainland.</p>

<p>Our figure of this Antelope (Plate LXXXII.) was put upon the stone by
Mr. Smit from a sketch prepared under Sir Victor Brooke’s directions
by Mr. J. Wolf. This was <i>probably</i> taken from the same animal
as that figured in the Zoological Society’s ‘Proceedings,’ as above
mentioned.</p>

</div>

<p>Height at withers about 48 inches. General colour of neck and body pale
greyish tawny. Head with a black frontal patch at the base of the horns
and a large patch of the same colour upon the nose, the two united by
a narrow black line. Above the eye is a black stripe extending to the
base of the horn, and below the eye a broad stripe passes downwards
towards the corner of the mouth and, uniting with the nasal patch,
spreads below on to the underside of the jaw; there is also a black
stripe running from near the base of the ear along the line where the
cheek passes into the neck and expanding on the lower part of the cheek
fuses with the lower extremity of the ocular stripe, and contributes to
the formation of the broad black area that occupies nearly the whole
of the inter-ramal space. Muzzle, chin, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> lips white. Ears with tip
and the adjacent edges black. From the dark inter-ramal area to the
chest extends a black stripe along the throat; the hairs of this region
long, forming a mane, which at one spot near the middle of the throat
is produced into a pointed crest or beard. Mane of nape blackish; a
black line traceable along the back as far as the rump. Rump black
or clouded with black above, the black extending on to the root of
the tail, the tuft of which is entirely black. Along the sides of the
body above the belly, which is white, extends a broad black stripe,
continuous in front with the black area of the chest and passing behind
on to the lower part of the thigh, where it expands into a broad black
patch covering the outer side of the hind leg as far as the hock and
spreading round the leg on its inner side. Hind legs below the hocks
nearly white, except for a longitudinal black stripe on the front of
the cannon-bone. Fore legs white below knee, with a black spot or
stripe on the front of the cannon-bone; above the knee on the outer and
inner side the leg is black almost up to the shoulder, but on the inner
side it is sometimes white above, the white area extending for a short
distance on to the front of the leg at its base.</p>

<p>Horns nearly straight, rarely attaining a length of about 47
inches, more commonly less than 40. A skull has the following
dimensions:&mdash;Basal length 14·5 inches, eye to nose 10, greatest width
6·25.</p>

<p><i>Female</i> similar to the male, but slighter, with longer and more
slender horns, which are less distinctly ringed and sometimes slightly
bent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Hab.</i> Arid deserts of South-west Africa, from Bechuanaland
north to Mossamedes.</p>
</div>

<p>The Dutch colonists who settled at the Cape in the course of the
seventeenth century named the principal Antelopes which they met with
there after the animals in Europe that they supposed to be their
closest allies, or to be most nearly similar to them, but in many cases
very inappropriately. Thus the “Eland” received its name from the
Elk (<i>Alces machlis</i>), the “Reh-bok” from the Roe (<i>Capreolus
caprœa</i>), and the present Antelope from the Chamois or Gemse of
the Alps (<i>Rupicapra tragus</i>), although in all these cases it is
difficult to discern much resemblance between the European species and
the South-African animals which were called after them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless the term “Gemsbok” has stuck to the Oryx of the Cape, and
is still a familiar name for this beautiful Antelope both among the
Dutch and the English in South Africa. As we have already shown, it is
the type, or at any rate the first species, of de Blainville’s genus
<i>Oryx</i>, and that must be its generic name, but to decide what term
should be selected as its proper specific name is by no means an easy
task.</p>

<p>The “<i>Capra gazella</i>” of the tenth and twelfth editions of
Linnæus’s ‘Systema Naturæ’ has been held by many authors to refer to
this species, whereas Pallas and his followers called the Leucoryx
“<i>Antilope gazella</i>” and the present species “<i>Antilope
oryx</i>” Modern writers have mostly called the Gemsbok either “<i>Oryx
capensis</i>, Ogilby” (a name that is undoubtedly applicable to it),
or “<i>Oryx gazella</i>” or “<i>Oryx oryx</i>” Of these three names we
think we are justified in selecting the Linnæan “<i>gazella</i>” which
has undoubted priority. It is true that Linnæus’s species is based
mainly on Ray’s very imperfectly described “<i>Gazella Indica cornibus
rectis longissimis nigris</i>,” and that its “habitat” is given as
“India.” But Pallas himself quotes Linnæus’s <i>Capra gazella</i> as
a synonym of his “<i>Antilope oryx</i>”&mdash;so that we cannot justly
use the latter term even if it were not the same as the generic
name. It may also be urged that traditionally at least Linnæus’s
term “<i>gazella</i>” has usually been acknowledged to refer to this
species, which we therefore propose to designate <i>Oryx gazella</i>.</p>

<p>As may be gathered from what has been already stated, most of the older
authors had no clear ideas as to the differences between this and the
two preceding Antelopes, which they only knew from imperfect specimens,
and did not even realize that their areas of distribution are in every
case perfectly distinct. We must, however, make one exception from
this statement. In the Dutch edition of Buffon’s ‘Histoire Naturelle,’
published by Schneider at Amsterdam, to which we have had occasion more
than once to refer, there will be found a very recognizable figure of
the Gemsbok, which the author identifies, perhaps correctly, with the
“Pasan” of Buffon. Allamand’s figure was taken from a skin received
from the Cape of Good Hope, and is accompanied by a full and fairly
accurate description. Both the figure and description of Allamand were
reprinted by Buffon in the sixth volume of his ‘Supplement’ to the
‘Histoire Naturelle,’ published at Paris in 1782. Allamand’s figure
was again copied by Schreber on plate cclvii. of his ‘Säugethiere,’
which is believed to have been issued (long before the letterpress)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> in
1784. It is there named “<i>Antilope oryx</i>, Pallas,” as is also the
case in the accompanying letterpress, issued in 1836, and in Wagner’s
supplementary volumes of the ‘Säugethiere,’ in which the plate of this
Antelope, published in 1848, is apparently also an improved copy of
Allamand’s original figure.</p>

<p>We will now turn to some of the chief authorities on the Natural
History of the Cape, and see what we can learn from them as to the
habits and exact distribution of the present animal, of which the
systematists tell us very little. Sparrman, who was in South Africa
in 1772 and the following years, after commenting on the unsuitable
appellation applied to it, says that the Gemsbok is in all probability
peculiar to the north-western part of the Colony, for that in the
country which he traversed, which was mainly east from Cape Town, he
neither saw nor heard anything of it. But its remarkable horns were
not at that period scarce in collections at Cape Town. Patterson,
about 1790, met with the Gemsbok in Clanwilliam; and Barrow, about ten
years later, seems to have come across it in Willowmore. Lichtenstein,
in the second volume of his travels (1812), notes the occurrence of
the Gemsbok in the Hopetown District, and writes of it as <i>Antilope
oryx</i>. Steedman, whose ‘Wanderings in South Africa’ were published
in 1835, devotes considerable attention to this animal and gives a good
figure of it (vol. ii. p. 55) from specimens obtained on the farm of
Stoffel Jacobs, near Bushman’s Poorte, just south of the Orange River.</p>

<p>We now come to the epoch of the celebrated traveller Sir William
Cornwallis Harris, who penetrated far into the interior of South
Africa in 1836 and 1837. On plate ix. of his ‘Portraits’ Harris gives
excellent figures accompanied by full descriptions of both sexes of
the Gemsbok, which he met with on the Moloppo and Modder Rivers in
Bechuanaland, and in the adjoining districts of the Orange Free State.
We extract the following passages from Harris’s lively chapter on this
Antelope:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The South-African Oryx is a most wild and warlike-looking
animal, not less remarkable for beauty, speed, and vigour, than
famed for the excellence of its venison, which is everywhere
held in the highest estimation. Although usually found in pairs
on the Karroos and unfrequented stony districts, which form
its invariable habitation, the males sometimes possess two
females, constituting, with their young, a family of five or
six individuals. The calves, which are born of a reddish cream
colour, become whiter as they increase in bulk, and are easily
domesticated; but their uncertain temper renders it difficult at
any time to pronounce them tame. Their horns, at first blunt and
round at the tips, are soon ground to a fine needle-like point,
by dint of raking and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span> whetting them against rough-stemmed
trees,&mdash;thus becoming most formidable weapons, whether of
offence or defence. The horns of the females are much longer and
more <i>bodkinish</i> in appearance than those of the males, who
never meet during the rutting season without desperate battles,
their courage and quarrelsome disposition frequently rendering
their duels fatal, one of the combatants often being run slap
through the body by a lunge from the long rapier-resembling
weapons of his antagonist. The natives of Southern Africa
occasionally arm their spears with the horns of the Oryx; and
the Hollanders of the Cape have them polished and headed with
silver, to serve as walking-sticks, for which purpose they are
frequently too long! Strong, active, and vigorous, the Gemsbok
boldly defends itself when pressed by the hunter, using its
horns with amazing energy and address, by striking right and
left at its assailant with prodigious violence. Oppian, the
modern Arabs of the desert, and the Hottentots, are all agreed
in describing the danger of approaching these animals before
they are totally disabled.”</p>
</div>

<p>A few years later another well-known sportsman, Roualeyn Gordon
Cumming, arrived in South Africa and commenced the five years of his
‘Hunter’s Life,’ of which he has given to the world such a vivid
description. Cumming first met with the Gemsbok in December 1843 in the
“vast Karroo plains” west of Colesberg, where it was abundant at that
epoch. He describes some of its chief peculiarities as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Gemsbok was destined by nature to adorn the parched karroos
and arid deserts of South Africa, for which description of
country it is admirably adapted. It thrives and attains high
condition in barren regions, where it might be imagined that
a locust would not find subsistence, and, burning as is its
climate, it is perfectly independent of water, which, from my
own observation and the repeated reports both of the Boers and
aborigines, I am convinced it never by any chance tastes. Its
flesh is deservedly esteemed, and ranks next to the Eland. At
certain seasons of the year they carry a great quantity of fat,
at which time they can be more easily ridden into. Owing to the
even nature of the ground which the Oryx frequents, its shy and
suspicious disposition, and the extreme distances from water to
which it must be followed, it is never stalked or driven to an
ambush like other Antelopes, but is hunted on horseback, and
ridden down by a long, severe, tail-on-end chase. Of several
animals in South Africa which are hunted in this manner, and may
be ridden into by a horse, the Oryx is by far the swiftest and
most enduring.”</p>
</div>

<p>In his ‘Hunter’s Wanderings’ Mr. Selous gives us an excellent account
of the range of the Gemsbok about twenty years ago. He says (p. 212):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Gemsbuck is almost entirely confined to the arid deserts
of South-western Africa. In the Kalahari desert, to the west
of Griqualand West, it is fairly plentiful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span> and on the road
leading along the eastern border of the desert from Kuruman
to Bamangwato it is occasionally to be met with, becoming
plentiful if one penetrates into the waterless country to the
westward, but being unknown to the eastward, of the road. Along
the waggon-road leading from Bamangwato to Tati there are a
few Gemsbuck above Pelatsi, Serule, and Goqui, and they are
sometimes to be met with on the upper course of the Macloutsi,
Shashi, and Tati rivers. A few sometimes even wander as far
eastwards as the Ramokwebani river. On the road leading from
Tati to the Zambesi Gemsbuck are not often met with, but a few
are occasionally to be seen in the neighbourhood of Thammasanka
and Thammasetsi. A little farther westwards, however, in the
neighbourhood of the great saltpans, they are numerous, as
they are also in all the country between the saltpans and the
Botletlie river, whilst to the west of that river, right through
the desert into Damaraland, they are said to run in large herds.
Where I have met with them, the country has either been open
or covered with stunted bush, and along the waggon-road from
Bamangwato to the Mābābe their northern range seems to
be limited by the heavily-timbered sand-belts, which run east
and west immediately to the south of that river, and into which
the Gemsbuck does not penetrate. North of the Mābābe, in
the direction of the Chobe, although many parts of the country
appear well fitted for it, the Gemsbuck is unknown.</p>

<p>“So far as my experience goes, the Gemsbuck is far from being
the fleetest or most enduring Antelope in South Africa, and in
these respects cannot be compared to the Tsessebe or Hartebeest.
I do not think it is either fleeter or more enduring than
the Sable or Roan Antelope; and I have myself run one to a
standstill without firing a shot, and I know of several other
men having done the same thing. The horns of the cow become
longer than those of the bull, as a rule; the longest pair of
the former I have ever seen measured 3 feet 10½ inches, and of
the latter 3 feet 6 inches,”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. H. A. Bryden, writing in 1889, describes the Gemsbok as then “very
nearly extinct in the Cape Colony.” Seven or eight years previously two
of the last had been shot in the north of Calvinia, near the banks of
the Orange River.</p>

<p>Mr. W. L. Sclater, Director of the South African Museum, Cape Town,
writing of the present distribution of the Gemsbok in South Africa,
informs us that, according to the statistics of the Agricultural
Department, there are about 5000 Gemsboks still existing in
Bechuanaland between Namaqualand and Kenhart. There are also said to
be plenty of these Antelopes still to be found throughout the German
South-west African territory and the western part of the Kalahari
Desert. North of German South-west Africa, we know from Capello and
Ivens, and other Portuguese authorities, that the Gemsbok is also found
in Mossamedes and in the adjoining arid districts of Southern Angola.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span></p>

<p>The Gemsbok is very rarely seen in captivity, and we are not aware
that living examples of it have ever been brought to Europe. Mr. Carl
Hagenbeck, of Hamburg, who has had great experience in such matters,
informs us that he has never seen this animal alive.</p>

<p>There is a fine mounted pair of the Gemsbok in the Gallery of the
British Museum, obtained by Mr. F. C. Selous in the Bamangwato District
of Bechuanaland, and a frontlet and horns procured by the same
enterprising hunter on the Botletli River. Besides these there are
several older stuffed specimens, as also some heads and skins, of which
the exact localities are unknown.</p>

<p>Our figure of the Gemsbok (Plate LXXXIII.) was drawn on the stone by
Mr. Smit from Mr. Wolf’s sketch, but it is, unfortunately, impossible
to ascertain from what specimen it was taken.</p>

<p>Height at withers about 46 inches. Colour of neck and body a tolerably
uniform tawny. Head and throat with the same ornamentation of black
stripes and patches as in the preceding species, but the nose-patch
does not spread so far laterally, and does not fuse with the lower
extremity of the stripe that runs from the eye; this stripe also stops
short at a point about on a level with the corner of the mouth, and
is not produced inferiorly on to the lower side of the jaw; thus the
whitish muzzle is not surrounded by a complete black ring as is the
case in <i>O. gazella</i>, and there is less black on the inter-ramal
area and on the upper end of the throat. Hair of throat not produced
to form a mane or beard. Ears black at tip and on rim as in <i>O.
gazella</i>. Black spinal stripe more sharply defined than in that
species and extending from a point near the middle of the rump;
hind-quarters of the same colour as the body and neck, there being no
black patch on the rump and none on the lower half of the thighs. The
black stripe that passes backwards from the chest along the side of the
body above the white belly is narrower than in <i>O. gazella</i>, and
is not continued on to the thighs. Hind legs whitish, not black above
the hocks, and without a black spot on front of the cannon-bone, but
stained with black above the false hoofs and below the hocks. Fore legs
whitish, banded as in <i>O. gazella</i>, but the stripe above the knee
narrower and only extending about halfway up to the shoulder on the
outer side, and to the chest on the inner. Tail-tuft black. Hairs along
the neck and spine lying forwards, the parting situated on the rump.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<p>The famous traveller and naturalist, Dr. Eduard Rüppell, of
Frankfort-on-the-Main, whose name we have already frequently mentioned
in this work, was the discoverer of this fine Antelope, which he
met with in 1832 on the coast of the Red Sea west of Massowa, and
subsequently described and figured in his ‘Neue Wirbelthiere.’
Rüppell called this animal “<i>Beisa</i>” after the native name by
which it was known to the Arabs of the district, and at the same time
attempted to identify it with an Antelope which he had heard of but
not obtained seven years previously in Dongola, there known as the
“<i>Dammah</i>.” But, as Heuglin has pointed out, it seems by no means
certain that the “<i>Beisa</i>” of the coastland of Abyssinia is the
same as the “<i>Dammah</i>” of Dongola. Although, therefore, the name
“<i>dammah</i>” as will be seen by our list of synonyms, was published
by Cretzschmar and Fischer before Rüppell’s “<i>beisa</i>” it would
be neither just nor reasonable upon this uncertain plea to deprive
Rüppell, who certainly supplied the first recognizable description of
it, of the name of this species.</p>

<p>Rüppell informs us that the Beisa in his time (about 1832) was not
uncommon in the low-country at the back of Massowa, and extended
northwards along the coast to Suakin. It was usually found in small
families in the flat valleys which are slightly grassed, and was said
to be fleet and shy, being much persecuted by the Turkish soldiers then
in garrison at Massowa.</p>

<p>Mr. W. T. Blanford, F.R.S., met with this Antelope in the same district
during the Abyssinian Expedition of 1867–68, and, in his volume on the
‘Geology and Zoology of Abyssinia,’ writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On returning from the interior I stopped for three days at a
halting-place in the semi-desert north of Massowa, and succeeded
in shooting four of these superb and rare Antelopes. All were
females; but there is little, if any, difference in the sexes,
both having equally fine horns.</p>

<p>“The Beisa is found singly or in small herds, rarely exceeding
ten in number, in the somewhat hilly barren country near the
sea-coast. They are said to keep to the more hilly parts of
Samhar. Near Annesley Bay, where the country is more wooded,
this Antelope does not occur, but it abounds farther south in
the Somali country, and the horns are brought in considerable
numbers to Aden and Berbera. They are used as weapons by the
Somalis.</p>

<p>“The principal food of the Oryx near Massowa is a coarse grass,
almost resembling a diminutive bamboo. They appear to be grazers
rather than browsers, although, like all Antelopes, they
occasionally eat the young shoots of Acacia and other trees.
They are quite diurnal in their habits, feeding in the morning
and evening, in this respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> resembling the Gazelles, to which
they are unquestionably closely allied. When we were in the
Samhar country in July and August, the Oryx drank apparently
every day, always coming to the water about one or two o’clock.
It is probable that they drink less regularly in cold weather.</p>

<p>“The appearance of a herd of Oryx is very imposing. They are
some of the most elegant and symmetrical of animals, their
motions being those of a wild horse rather than of an Antelope.
Their favourite pace appears to be either a steady quick walk or
a trot; they rarely break into a gallop unless greatly alarmed.
When frightened, they dash off, sometimes snorting and putting
their heads down as if charging, raising their long tails, and
looking very formidable. They are wary animals, though far less
so than some other Antelopes.</p>

<p>“Like the Gazelles and true Antelopes, all equally inhabitants
of deserts and open plains, the Oryx has a pointed foot, each
of the divisions being rudely triangular. Its tracks may
consequently be instantly distinguished from those of cattle
or of any of the bovine Antelopes. So far as my acquaintance
with the family goes, most of the forest and bush-hunting
Antelopes&mdash;Koodoo, Nylgai, <i>Tetraceros</i>&mdash;have their feet
formed like those of the <i>Cervidæ</i>, with rounded hoofs,
whilst the Antelopes of the plain, and especially desert forms,
have pointed hoofs.”</p>
</div>

<p>Heuglin met with this Antelope further south on the Danakil coast of
the Red Sea, and also in Northern Somaliland, where he states that
it resorts to the more open sandy districts beset with low bushes
(<i>Salvadora</i>), occasionally retreating into the lower hills.</p>

<p>But in Somaliland we have excellent accounts of its habits and
distribution from modern observers&mdash;of whom we will first quote Captain
Swayne, the leading authority on the game-animals of that country.</p>

<p>Writing of the Antelopes in his ‘Seventeen Trips through Somaliland,’
Col. Swayne sums up his great experience of the Beisa as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Oryx of Somaliland is a very stoutly-built, bovine
Antelope, standing as high as a donkey, and inhabits open stony
ground, or barren hills, or open grass plains. It is fairly
common and very widely distributed over the Somali country, and
it may be found in all kinds of country except in the thick
jungle with aloe undergrowth (which is so much liked by the
Lesser Koodoo), and the cedar-forests on the higher ranges. The
best Oryx ground is in the Haud and in Ogádén.</p>

<p>“The Oryx feeds chiefly on grass, and is often found very far
from water. It has a keen sight, and probably protects itself
more by this than by its sense of hearing or scent. Oryxes are
found in herds of from half a dozen to thirty or forty, chiefly
composed of cows. Bull Oryxes are found wandering singly all
over the country, and possibly these make up in number for the
preponderance of cows in the herds.</p>

<p>“Sometimes two or three cows with growing calves will be found
together, making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> up a small herd of half a dozen. It is nearly
impossible to distinguish which are the bulls in a herd, and
they are so few in proportion to the cows that it is best, if
shooting for sport alone, not to fire at a herd at all. The
bull is slightly thicker in the neck and higher in the withers
than the cow; and the horns, though an inch or two shorter in
the bull, are more massive, especially about the base, and more
symmetrical, whilst the cow’s horns are frequently bent and
of unequal length. The Oryx is often revengeful when wounded
and brought to bay; twice I have seen a wounded one make a
determined charge into a mob of Somális armed with spears.</p>

<p>“The Midgáns, who are armed with bows and poisoned arrows,
hunt the Oryx with packs of savage yellow pariah-dogs. The
thick skin round the withers of a bull is made by them into a
white <i>gáshan</i> or fighting shield. The method of hunting,
as carried out by the Midgáns in the Bulhár Plain, is as
follows:&mdash;Three or four of them, with about fifteen dogs, go out
just before dawn, and walk along silently through the scattered
thorn-trees till fresh tracks are found, and these are followed
till the game is sighted. By throwing stones, whistling, and
other signs which the dogs understand, they are shown the herd,
and settle down to their work. The dogs run mute, the men
following at a crouching trot, which in a Somáli is untiring;
and this lasts until the dogs open in chorus, having brought
the game to bay. The Oryxes make repeated charges at the dogs,
which, they often wound or kill. If the latter can avoid
the sharp horns of the mother they fasten on to a calf, and
sometimes the whole herd will charge to the rescue. The Midgáns
run up silently under cover of the bushes and let off a flight
of poisoned arrows into the herd, which, seeing the human enemy,
takes to flight. Frequently an animal wounded by a poisoned
arrow takes a line of its own, and is in due time carefully
followed up and found dead, or it may be pulled down in its weak
state by the dogs,”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. D. G. Elliot, in his report on the collection of the Mammals of
Somaliland made for the Field-Columbian Museum of Chicago in 1896,
writes of the Beisa as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Oryxes are not often seen in the country north of the Golis
Range, but their numbers increase as the Haud is traversed,
and on the south of Toyo and in Ogaden they are plentiful.
At a distance it is impossible to distinguish the bulls from
the cows, as both carry horns, those of the cows more slender
and usually longer than the average of bulls’ horns. But this
difference in size is not perceptible unless one is very close
to the animals. The horns are annulated for two-thirds their
length, then become smooth, and end in a sharp point. The
average lengths of bulls’ horns are not much over 30 inches,
although occasionally specimens are obtained that are several
inches longer, and the cows’ horns sometimes reach a length of
37 or 38 inches. They are very formidable weapons, and it is
dangerous to approach a wounded Oryx. In charging its enemy the
Oryx puts its head low down between its fore legs, with the
horns pointed forward not much above the ground, and rushes at
the object of its hate with much swiftness. These lance-like
horns are quite capable of passing entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> through the body
of an animal. Oryxes seem to be quite independent of water,
and are often seen many miles from any place where it could
be procured. They frequent the waterless, treeless plains,
such as Toyo, Silo, &amp;c., in herds sometimes of large size, and
subsist upon the harsh dry grass common in such localities. The
skin of a bull is very thick on the neck and withers, in, some
cases as much as three-quarters of an inch through. The natives
select this part of the hide to make their shields, which are
sufficiently tough to stop any spear or arrow. As the bulls are
very pugnacious, no doubt their tough thick hides are a great
protection against the lance-like horns, and save them from
being run through this vital portion of the body.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Elliot’s expedition brought home twelve specimens of the Beisa of
both sexes and of various ages from the Toyo Plain, Hullier, Bodeleh,
the Silo Plain, the Haud, and the Ogaden Country. But he tells us that
this fine animal is already practically extinct north of the Golis
Range, and can only be found in any numbers in the southern portion of
the Haud and in the country beyond.</p>

  </div>

<p>Mr. J. Benett Stanford, F.Z.S., a well-known sportsman in Somaliland,
tells us a curious story about this Antelope. On one occasion when
shooting in that country he killed a female Beisa, and, leaving his men
to skin her, went on in pursuit of other game. On his return to the
camp, late in the afternoon, he found a young Beisa frolicking about,
and was greeted by one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span> the party with the words “How <i>did</i>
you catch it?” It appeared that the men had cut the young animal out
from the dead mother, and found it perfectly formed in every respect.
This young Antelope lived with the caravan for several months, and was
eventually killed by an accident.</p>

<p>The following extract from Capt. Francis B. Pearce’s recently published
‘Rambles in Lion-Land’ will show that, notwithstanding the persecutions
of the numerous sportsmen who now visit the Somaliland Protectorate
every winter, the Beisa is as yet by no means an extinct animal in the
interior of that attractive country:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We struck camp after having spent a very successful week on
the Tyuli Hills, and turned our faces south <i>en route</i> for
the zebra-country. Shortly after leaving camp I saw the largest
herd of Oryx I have ever seen. It is a difficult matter to
estimate the number of a herd of animals unless one possesses
some education in that line, but at the lowest estimate there
could not have been less than five hundred head. This enormous
herd galloped past us at a distance of a little over two hundred
yards. It was a beautiful sight to watch. With glistening coats
and horns laid back, they tore past. Both J&mdash;&mdash; and I were too
fascinated to think of firing.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Beisa is well known in the Zoological Gardens of Europe, and has
bred in captivity on more than one occasion. The first living example
of this Antelope (a male) was received by the Zoological Society of
London, as a present from Admiral Cumming, in 1874, and a female was
presented by the Sultan of Zanzibar in the following year, from which
the figure in the Society’s ‘Garden Guide’ for 1876 (see fig. 94, p.
70) was taken. This made a pair of this animal for the Collection,
believed at that time to be the only pair in Europe. In 1877 and 1878
other specimens were obtained. On April 12th, 1881, the first calf
was born, and in September 1885 a second calf from the same pair. At
the present time there are three representatives of this Oryx in the
Society’s Collection, and specimens of it may also be seen in many of
the Zoological Gardens on the Continent.</p>

<p>A coloured figure of the first Beisa calf born in the Zoological
Society’s Gardens will be found in the ‘Proceedings’ for 1881 (plate
liv.).</p>

<p>In the British Museum there is an adult mounted female specimen of the
Beisa Antelope, from the Red Sea coast, obtained in 1871. There is
also the skull of an adult from the River Juba, obtained by Sir John
Kirk and presented by him in 1879, besides other skins and skulls from
various parts of Somaliland presented by Mr. W. F. Sinclair, Col. A.
Paget, and Capt. Swayne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p>Our figure of this species (Plate LXXXIV.) was lithographed by Mr. Smit
for Sir Victor Brooke many years ago, and was taken, it is believed,
from a specimen in the British Museum.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the same size and general characters as the preceding species, to
which it is very closely allied. The colour seems to be usually of a
richer ruddier tint, and the black stripe on the face that passes from
the eye towards the corner of the mouth is generally, but not always;
continued downwards on to the lower edge of the jaw, thence backwards,
bounding the inter-ramal area on each side and uniting with the lower
end of the stripe that runs from below the base of the ear to the
throat. In some cases, however, the stripe in question stops short
behind the corner of the mouth as in <i>O. beisa</i>. The frontal patch
and the nose-patch are sometimes entirely separated, sometimes joined
by a narrow stripe as in <i>O. beisa</i>. The stripes on the body and
fore legs resemble those of <i>O. beisa</i>, but there is no black
patch upon the front of the cannon-bone on the fore leg, such as is
present in that species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p>The most striking difference between the two species consists in the
development of the hairs on the tips of the ears in <i>O. callotis</i>
so as to form a long black tuft; in <i>O. beisa</i> the hairs at the
extremity of the ear are scarcely longer than those covering the
adjacent edges of that organ. Lastly, in <i>O. callotis</i>, the hairs
along the median dorsal line are reversed in direction of growth from
a point, only a little behind the middle of the back; whereas in <i>O.
beisa</i> the parting is situated on the rump.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Hab.</i> British East Africa, south of the River Tana, and
interior of German East Africa.</p>
</div>

<p>Southwards of the River Tana in British East Africa, or thereabouts,
the Beisa appears to be replaced by a nearly allied form,
distinguishable by the conspicuous tufts which adorn the tips of
its ears and by other less noticeable characters. It will be easily
understood that this animal was not at once distinguished from the
typical form by those who first met with it, and was consequently
referred to “<i>Oryx beisa</i>” by Mr. Hunter in his Appendix
to Willoughby’s ‘Big Game in East Africa,’ and by other earlier
authorities.</p>

<p>It was not, in fact, until 1892 that the conspicuous difference of
this species from <i>O. beisa</i>, as regards its ears, attracted
notice, when Mr. Rowland Ward, F.Z.S., first called Thomas’s attention
to it. Thomas, after examining into the subject, brought it before
the notice of the Zoological Society of London on March 15th of that
year, and proposed to call the new form <i>Oryx callotis</i>. Thomas’s
communication was subsequently printed in the Society’s ‘Proceedings’
accompanied by a good coloured figure of the mounted head of the
typical specimen, which was subsequently presented by Messrs. Rowland
Ward and Co. to the British Museum.</p>

<p>As will be seen by reference to Mr. Rowland Ward’s ‘Records of Big
Game,’ the horns of this typical specimen are among the shortest of
the series of 18 specimens of this species of which measurements are
there given, the longest pairs being over 30 inches in length. These
latter are, no doubt, those of females, which in all the species of
<i>Oryx</i> seem to be rather longer and thinner than those of males.</p>

<p>In the first volume of ‘Big Game Shooting’ in the ‘Badminton
Library,’ Mr. F. J. Jackson gives us the following account of <i>Oryx
callotis</i> in British East Africa:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The East African Oryx is known to the Swahilis as ‘Cheroa.’ The
Cheroa is found in the Kilimanjaro district in greater numbers
(particularly near Useri) than elsewhere. It is also plentiful
in the Galla country, between the Sabaki and Tana rivers, and I
have myself seen it within a mile of the sea at Merereni.</p>

<p>“It is found more often in open bush country than in the bare
arid plains. It is not only a beautiful beast, but is very
shy, difficult to approach, and exceedingly tough, and for
these reasons many sportsmen covet its head more than the
trophies of any other kind of Antelope. The skin of its neck
is extraordinarily thick, and <i>à propos</i> of this, all
head-skins preserved as trophies should have the skin of the
neck shaved down to at least half its thickness to ensure its
being properly cured.</p>

<p>“The Oryx is found in herds varying in number from six or eight
up to thirty or forty. A bull Oryx is often found entirely
by himself, and occasionally along with a herd of <i>Gazella
granti</i> or other Antelopes. It is perhaps as well to warn
sportsmen to approach Oryx, when lying wounded, with caution,
as on one occasion my gun-bearer, on going up to cut the throat
of an Oryx, received a severe blow on the thigh from the side
of one of the wounded beast’s horns. The blow might have been
very serious had the Oryx caught him with the point of his horns
instead of with the flat.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. R. B. P. Cator, of the British East African Administrative Service,
sends us the following account of his adventures with this Antelope:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On the morning of the 20th February, 1898, I fell in with a
herd of Oryx on my way down from Machakos to Kibwezi. The herd
consisted of some 15 to 20 animals or possibly more. When I
first saw them they were feeding near some thickets on the
edge of a broad open piece of ground that lay between them and
myself, and I was unable to gain cover before I was detected. On
seeing me the herd divided and made off in different directions,
but, so far as I could judge, the two parts effected a junction
before I saw them again. The country hereabout consists of open
glades and meadows of all sizes alternating with impenetrable
thickets, so being very anxious to secure a specimen of an Oryx,
a very uncommon Antelope in this part of the country, I made a
long detour, and, by good fortune, again hit off what was, I
have not the least doubt, the same herd or a portion of it.</p>

<p>“Without detailing the various attempts that I made to get a
good shot it is enough to say that I was fortunate enough to
secure two specimens, the one a very fine bull and the other a
cow.</p>

<p>“The horns of the bull measure respectively 33½″ and 32″ on the
outer curve; circumference of largest horn 7″ and distance from
tip to tip 13″: all these measurements exceeding those of the
best East African Oryx given in Ward’s book. The horns of the
cow are fairly good but much worn and cracked.”</p>
</div>

<p>Our figure of this Antelope (Plate LXXXV.) has been prepared by Mr.
Smit from the skin and skull of the male specimen obtained on this
occasion by Mr. Cator, who kindly placed them at our disposal for this
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span></p>

<p>The Tufted Beisa extends south of the British Protectorate far into the
interior of German East Africa.</p>

<p>Herr Matschie, in his valuable volume on the Mammals of the German
Protectorate, includes this Antelope in his list, and gives a figure of
it in the text. He tells us that it was met with in Southern Masailand,
south-east of Irangi, by Stuhlmann, and in Northern Ugogo, between
Mpapwa and Usandawe, by Neumann. This, so far as we know, gives its
furthest extension south. We are not aware that the Tufted Beisa has
ever been imported alive to Europe.</p>

<p>The typical head of <i>Oryx callotis</i> already mentioned is the only
example of this form of Oryx in the collection of the British Museum.</p>

<p>Height at withers about 38 inches. Colour of head, neck, and body in
winter a tolerably uniform brownish grey; in summer the hairy covering
of the body between the neck and hind-quarters assumes a richer and
redder hue, the head and neck remaining the same throughout the year.
Mane on forehead nearly black, and back of head behind horns darkish
brown; lips and chin white; a broad white stripe on each side of the
face extending from near the middle of the cheek upwards in front of
and above the eye, and usually meeting its fellow of the opposite
side across the upper portion of the nose, though sometimes the union
is interrupted in the middle by the black hairs of the frontal mane.
Ears mostly white, sometimes blackish at the base; an ill-defined
whitish patch sometimes present behind the eye and a black patch on the
lower edge of the cheek close to the neck. Fore legs white, with the
exception of a brown patch on the knee, a brown rim round the false
hoofs, and a tinge of brown which extends downwards on to their upper
portions from the shoulder; a black patch sometimes present between
the shoulder and the throat; the dark colour of the back and flanks
spreads for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span> a short distance on to the hind-quarters; otherwise the
hind-quarters, tail, and hind legs are white, the rump and thighs
being a dirtier white than the legs. As in the case of the front legs,
however, there is a rim of brown hairs round the false hoofs, and the
tail-tuft, when present, is brownish. Belly white. Hairs along middle
of neck sometimes reversed.</p>

<p>The horns attain a length of about 28 inches in a straight line and
about 36 following the spiral.</p>

<p>Skull and horns as described above. The measurements of a skull
are:&mdash;Basal length 12 inches, greatest breadth 5·30, muzzle to orbit

</div>

<p>The Addax belongs to the same group of desert-haunting Antelopes as
the species of <i>Oryx</i> of which we have just treated, and is
essentially of the same structure. But it is at once distinguishable by
its spiral horns and expanded hoofs, and may properly be referred to
another genus, which Rafinesque in 1815 seems to have been the first
to call “<i>Addax</i>” adopting the name from Pliny and other early
writers. In 1816 De Blainville gave the first scientific description
of this Antelope, calling it <i>Antilope naso-maculatus</i>, from
the conspicuous white blaze across the nose. Combining this with the
generic term above mentioned, we obtain “<i>Addax naso-maculatus</i>”
as the correct scientific name of this Antelope.</p>

<p>It should be stated that the description given by Pliny of his
“<i>Strepsiceros, quem Addacem Africa appellat</i>” is very short and
incomplete, and has been variously interpreted by subsequent writers.
But as it was an African animal with twisted horns, and the native Arab
name of the present species, according to Hemprich and Ehrenberg, is
“<i>Abu Akass</i>” (the father of the twist), it seems highly probable
that we have in it the veritable “<i>Addax</i>” of the ancients.</p>

<p>The first naturalist of modern days to obtain specimens of the Addax
in its native wilds was Rüppell, who met with it in the deserts of
Dongola south of Ambukol, where, he tells us, it lives in small
families apart from all other species of Antelopes, and is hunted by
the Arabs on horseback in summer time. Rüppell forwarded examples
of both sexes of the Addax to Frankfort, where it was described and
figured by Cretzschmar in 1826 from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span> Rüppell’s specimens. Cretzschmar
identified it as being without doubt the “<i>Addax</i>” of Pliny, and
named it <i>Antilope addax</i>, being apparently unaware that it had
been previously described by De Blainville from specimens which he had
examined in London in the Pantherion of Bullock and in the Museum of
the Royal College of Surgeons.</p>

<p>About the same period Hemprich and Ehrenberg had obtained examples of
the same Antelope for the Berlin Museum, apparently from nearly the
same district. These were first described and figured by Lichtenstein
in his ‘Darstellung der Säugethiere,’ and subsequently by Hemprich and
Ehrenberg themselves in their ‘Symbolæ Physicæ.’ They tell us that
they were obtained about twenty hours’ distant from Ambukol, in the
Chor-el-Lebben, where these animals are hunted by the Kubabish Arabs on
horseback, in the month of June. Three specimens were sent home, which
we suppose are the same that are figured in their plate, and represent,
according to their descriptions, an adult female and two young females
with straight horns.</p>

<p>Our third great authority on the Mammals of North-east Africa, Th.
v. Heuglin, informs us that the Addax extends northwards into the
Libyan Desert of Egypt, to the Fayoum and the Oases, and is not rare
in the Bayuda Desert. Though he writes as having met with this species
himself, he does not give us the exact locality in which he came across
it.</p>

<p>Passing westwards, we have no doubt of the occurrence of the Addax in
suitable localities all through the Great Sahara, although we have
little certain information on the subject, except that a pair of horns,
brought back by Denham and Clapperton from their adventurous journey
across Central Africa in 1822–24, is in the British Museum.</p>

<p>But the Addax is still to be found in Southern Tunis, whence living
examples were formerly brought to England by Louis Fraser and other
collectors. In his article on the larger Mammals of Tunisia, published
in the Zoological Society’s ‘Proceedings’ for 1898, Sir Harry Johnston
tells us that this fine Antelope “is still a Tunisian animal, although
now rarely heard of north of the limits of the real sandy desert.”</p>

<p>The same kind friend and correspondent, writing to Sclater from Tunis
in January 1898, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have just come back from an interesting journey through
the Tunisian Sahara, and back by Tebessa, as you suggested. I
penetrated south to 32° nearly. I found that the Addax (though
I did not see one) was still fairly abundant in the desert, and
I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> bought several very fine pairs of horns from the Arabs. But
the finest pair that I saw was at Meduin (Military headquarters,
Tunisian Sahara) in the house of the Commandant. He allowed
me to measure and draw it (see the sketch, fig. 95). You will
notice that this example has a third twist; the majority of male
Addaxes only attain to two or two and a half, though I have a
pair in my collection here which verges on the third turn.</p>

<p>“The cow Addax (see the drawing, fig. 96) has much slenderer and
much less spiral horns, which have departed far less markedly
from the Orygine type.”</p>

  </div>

<p>Another excellent authority on the Mammals of Tunisia, Mr. Joseph S.
Whitaker, F.Z.S., has most kindly placed at our disposal the following
results of his observations on this Antelope:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Addax, which is called by the Tunisian Arabs
<i>Bakrah-el-Ouasch</i>, or Wild Cow, is still to be found in
the inland desert-country of the south of the Regency, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
of late years, even in these remote and uninhabited districts,
its numbers seem to have diminished considerably. This is said
to be owing to the fact of the peace that has lately reigned
between the Saharan Arabs and the Touaregs having enabled the
former to devote themselves more to the chase than in the
previous times of warfare. The meat of this animal, it appears,
is much esteemed by the Arabs as food, while the hides are still
more highly prized for the purpose of making the soles of shoes
and sandals.</p>

<p>“With regard to the present range of the Addax in the Tunisian
Sahara, I cannot speak from personal knowledge, never having
myself penetrated sufficiently far inland to meet with it; but
in the course of my travels from time to time in South Tunis I
have done my best to obtain reliable information on the subject.
Among others, Herr Spatz, who has resided for several years
in South Tunis, and is, perhaps, as competent an authority on
the matter as any living European, informs me that up to three
years ago the Addax was to be met with in considerable numbers
in the neighbourhood of Bir Aouine (or Bir Auin), which lies
to the east of Berezof, or some eighty miles south of the
Chott Djerid, thence extending its range in a southerly and
south-westerly direction, throughout the sand-dune country, down
to Ghadames, where, from all accounts, the species is abundant.
During the last three years, however, it appears the Antelopes
have become much scarcer in the country north of Ghadames, and
this year they were not to be met with at all anywhere near
Bir Aouine. Whether this is due to the incessant persecution
of the Arab hunters above referred to, or whether it is merely
due to dry seasons, and the consequent lack of food in these
thirsty regions having kept the animals away, I cannot say; but
as a proof of the recent defection of the Addax in the Tunisian
Sahara I may mention the fact of a party of five native hunters
this spring having only succeeded in obtaining seven of these
Antelopes in an expedition lasting 37 days, while in 1895 a
similar party killed ten of the animals in a short trip of 12
days. The Tunisian Arabs hunt the Addax in the same way as
they do the pale desert Gazelle (<i>G. leptoceros</i>), viz.
by stalking, in which art they are certainly proficients, and
it is well for the preservation of the species, with all the
keen-wittedness of its race, that these men are, as a rule,
armed with but primitive flint-lock weapons, little better than
gas-pipes, with a very limited range. Were it otherwise, the
Addax would probably long ere this have been exterminated in
this part of North Africa.</p>

<p>“This Antelope seems generally to be met with in very small
herds, or in pairs, and the young are born, as a rule, in the
winter or very early spring, never more than one being produced
at a birth, according to my informants. The Arabs sometimes
capture the young Addax alive, and I have on more than one
occasion been offered fawns of a few weeks old.</p>

  </div>

<p>“I have in my collection two complete skins of the Addax
obtained in South Tunis in the month of May, both of a
milk-white hue, evidently the summer coat, the hair being very
short and fine; while other skins in my possession obtained in
February and March are of an isabelline dun-colour, and with the
hair rather long and coarse, the winter garb, which no doubt
varies in intensity of colour according to the season. The thick
frontal tuft of hair seems to be of a dark brown colour at all
seasons, while part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> of the face below the transversal white
nose-band is a lightish brown, as is also the fringe of hair
on the throat. On the nape there is a slight indication of a
mane, but it is so slight in some specimens as to be scarcely
noticeable. The tail is rather short and tufted. Both males and
females carry beautifully-shaped spiral horns, those of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
former being, as a rule, longer and stouter than those of the
latter. The horns vary somewhat in the amount of spiral twist,
probably according to age, as will be seen by two specimens of
which the following are the measurements:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I also send a photograph of the head of a female Addax, almost
adult (see fig. 97, p. 85).</p>

<p>“Since writing the foregoing I have received from South Tunis
the complete skin and head of a fine male Addax obtained in the
early part of this year (1898). The horns of this specimen are
remarkably long, being in fact quite a record pair, and measure
as much as 38½ inches along the front curves, and 30½ inches in
a straight line. I have presented this specimen to the National
Museum at South Kensington.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Addax has likewise been the object of an expedition into the Sahara
made by Mr. A. E. Pease, M.P., F.Z.S., who, in the Zoological Society’s
‘Proceedings’ for 1896, has given us the following account of his
adventures in search of it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In February 1895, furnished with all the information I could
obtain from M. Foureau and natives familiar with the <i>Erg</i>,
Sir Edmund Loder and I started from Biskra to reach the country
between El Oued Souf and Rhadamis. After a week’s journey across
the desert by way of the great Chotts we reached the Oued Souf.
At El Oued, the last outpost of the French in the direction
of Rhadamis, we were stopped till Capitaine de Prandière had
obtained instructions from the General of Division permitting
us to go on. After a detention, made pleasant by the great
kindness and hospitality of the three French officers in command
of the native garrison, we had the disappointment of being told
that we could not be allowed to proceed southwards. At the time
we thought this very hard, for though we were aware that the
Touaregs had lately raided the Chambas as near as Mey, we felt
that a flying visit to the country east of Bir Beresof would
be without danger, as we could be in and out again before our
presence was discovered. But a few months later M. Foureau and
a strong force were driven back from the south, though he had
reached a point far beyond our proposed destination, and I think
our hosts were entirely justified in their refusal. Our plan
had been to reach Bir Beresof, and then to strike east for Bir
Aoueen, where we should in all probability have come up with
the Addax, which visits this district in large quantities in
favourable years. The Addax country is the Erg, the great region
of sand-dunes, covered more or less thickly with vegetation
according to situation and rains. This sand-dune country covers
hundreds&mdash;it may be said thousands&mdash;of miles and the Addax
follows the rains. In certain districts it is not uncommon for
rain not to fall for several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span> years in succession. In one year
the Addax are only found far south of Rhadamis and Aïn Taïba (S.
of Ouargla), in other years they follow the rain as far north as
the southern borders of the Chott Djereed in the east and the
neighbourhood of Aïn Taïba in the west. Without the help of the
French and a good escort of Chambas it would be vain to attempt
to reach the Rhadamis country by way of Bir Beresof; and the
wells being sometimes nine days apart, it is a difficult route
to follow.</p>

<p>“I heard when at Touzer that a M. Cornex had obtained a
‘<i>Begra el Ouash</i>’ within a few days of Douz; possibly
this was the Bubal, though I was assured that he had got the
Addax. M. Cornex (a Swiss) had adopted the religion and dress of
the Arabs, and had therefore facilities of reaching places and
avoiding dangers that were quite exceptional.</p>

<p>“In 1894 the Touaregs raided as far north as the southern
shores&mdash;if they can be called shores&mdash;of the Chott Djereed. In
1895 we crossed the western end of this Chott, and, so far as we
could judge or learn, the Chott was without water in any part;
it had been an exceptionally dry year, and the country between
the mountains and the Djereed we found absolutely devoid of
inhabitants.</p>

<p>“At El Oued there was in the fort a tame Addax familiarly
called ‘<i>Begra</i>,’ and this was the only living specimen
we saw during our journey. It was not a very good example, but
had rather a fine pair of horns. It had been presented by some
Chambas to the Commandant.”</p>
</div>

<p>From Morocco we have no intelligence of the Addax, although it will be
doubtless found there in the desert south of the Atlas. From Senegal,
likewise, we have little certain to record except the receipt of living
animals of this species on more than one occasion, especially a fine
pair now in the Zoological Garden at Antwerp, where Sclater has lately
examined them. We do not usually quote Rochebrune’s ‘Faune de la
Sénégambie,’ as it is hardly a reliable authority, but we find that he
says that the Addax is “common” in Cayor and Oualo on the right bank
of the River Senegal, and this river is probably its southern limit on
this side of Africa.</p>

<p>The Addax is occasionally, but not very frequently, brought to
Europe alive. In the twelfth volume of the ‘Nova Acta’ of the
Leopoldino-Carolinian Academy (1824) will be found a figure and
description by Dr. A. W. Otto of this Antelope, taken from a fresh
specimen that had died in a menagerie. Otto described it as belonging
to a new species, “<i>Antilope suturosa</i>,” but it was manifestly
only an Addax in its darker winter coat.</p>

<p>In 1827 Geoffroy St.-Hilaire and F. Cuvier published a description of
this Antelope in their great work upon Mammals from a male specimen
living in the Jardin des Plantes, received from the then Pasha of
Egypt. Figures are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> given of this animal (pls. 388, 389) in both its
summer and winter dress, and it is pointed out that in the latter it is
the <i>Antilope suturosa</i> of Otto.</p>

<p>The Zoological Society of London appear to have first received living
examples of the Addax in 1849. In 1861 a fine male was presented to the
Society by Sir John Gaspard Le Marchant, then Governor of Malta. In
1864 one was obtained by purchase, and in 1876 another. At the present
time there are no examples of the Addax in the London Gardens, but
last summer there was, as already stated, a fine pair in the Jardin
Zoologique of Antwerp.</p>

<p>Our illustration of this animal (Plate LXXXVI.) was put upon the stone
by Mr. Smit, some twenty years ago, from a water-colour sketch made for
Sir Victor Brooke by Mr. Wolf. It represents an adult animal in summer
pelage.</p>

<p>The British Museum contains a fine adult mounted male of this
Antelope, from the Tunisian Sahara, lately presented by Mr. J. I. S.
Whitaker; a front and horns from the Algerian Sahara, presented by
Mr. Rowland Ward, F.Z.S.; a pair of horns brought home from Central
Africa by Denham and Clapperton; and the specimen, formerly in
Bullock’s Museum, upon which de Blainville partly based his <i>Antilope
naso-maculata</i>, and Hamilton Smith his <i>A. mytilopes</i>; besides
other older specimens without exact localities.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Male.</i> About four feet six inches in height at the withers.
General colour of the head iron-grey, due to the hairs being black at
the base and white at the extremities; nose, neck, and cheeks tinted
with black; whitish grey above the eye; two small white cheek-spots
generally traceable. Lips and chin white; a large white patch at the
upper extremity of the throat; inter-ramal area also white. Ears
greyish white, blacker behind towards the extremities, and furnished
with two black spots on the outer edge in front. Upper parts of the
body iron-grey, like the head; lower portion, chest, and belly black,
except a median ventral white streak; groin, inner side of thighs
above, and subcaudal area of rump pure white, the latter emphasized
on each side by a black vertical streak on the buttocks. Tail white
below and at the sides, grey above; tuft white at the base, black at
the tip. Fore and hind limbs black inside and outside, except for
two large white spots on the front and outer sides of the pasterns
and on the outer and inner sides of the fetlocks; fetlock-spot of
hind leg sometimes extending right round the front to form a complete
half-ring; the corresponding spots on the fore legs much smaller, the
outer obsolete. A long tuft of black hair on the throat below the white
patch; a short hog-mane on the nape formed of stiff hairs, whitish at
the base, blackish at the ends; parting of hair on the withers; behind
this point a spinal mane of longish black hairs extends to nearly the
middle of the back and is represented as far as the root of the tail by
a narrow stripe of short black hairs.</p>

<p><i>Female.</i> Without horns. Smaller and slighter than the male and
of a fawn or tawny hue throughout, but with the same white patches
and markings as in the male, the fetlock and pastern spots being very
conspicuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> and set off with black. A short hog-mane on the nape, but
no tuft on the throat.</p>

<p><i>Young male.</i> Like the female in colour.</p>

<p>Measurements of an adult male skull:&mdash;Basal length 16·3 inches,
greatest breadth 5·75, muzzle to orbit 10, horn 8·5.</p>

<p>Horns usually from 8 to 9 inches long, with a basal girth of about 8
inches, and rarely reaching a length of 11·75 inches, with a basal
girth of 9·5.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Hab.</i> The Peninsula of India from the base of the
Himalayas to the south of Mysore; North-west Provinces, Eastern
Punjab, Guzerat, and the Konkan; but not extending to the Indus
on the west, nor into Eastern Bengal, nor into Malabar. Entirely
absent from the countries to the east of the Bay of Bengal.</p>
</div>

<p>The Asiatic division of the Tragelaphine group, which, in the existing
stage of the Earth’s fauna, is represented only by the present species,
is nearly as different in its structure as it is in its geographical
range from its African brethren, being at once distinguishable by its
short hind limbs, untwisted horns, bovine nose, and hypsodont molars,
not to mention its very different style of colour. The Asiatic form
might, in fact, be more naturally arranged as constituting a Subfamily
of itself, but we are content to follow recent authorities who have
associated this animal with the more typical Tragelaphs of Africa.</p>

<p>The “Nilgai” (said by some authorities to be more correctly written
“Nilgau,” from <i>nil</i> or <i>lil</i>, blue, and <i>gau</i>, cow) was
first introduced into scientific literature by Pallas in his memoir
on the genus <i>Antilope</i> published in 1766. Pallas’s “<i>Antilope
tragocamelus</i>,” as he called this species, was based partly upon
Ray, who quoted from Gesner, and partly on the description of Dr. James
Parsons, F.R.S., who, in the forty-third volume of the ‘Philosophical
Transactions,’ published in 1745, gave a very fair description of this
animal from a living male specimen “brought,” as he tells us, “from
Bengal, and shown in London.” There can be no doubt as to the identity
of Parsons’s “Quadruped,” whatever we may say regarding the less
accurate descriptions of Ray and Gesner, and it follows, consequently,
that “<i>tragocamelus</i>” must be used as the earliest and most
correct specific name of the Nilgai.</p>

<p>In the supplement to his memoir on the genus <i>Antilope</i> published
in 1777,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> besides <i>A. tragocamelus</i>, Pallas introduced into his
list an <i>Antilope picta</i>, founded upon Pennant’s “White-footed
Antelope.” On referring to Pennant’s description and figure of
this animal in his ‘Synopsis of Quadrupeds,’ there can be no doubt
whatever that they likewise refer to the Nilgai. They were taken, as
the author informs us, from a pair of animals living at Clermont in
1770. Following Pallas’s second name, a large number of authorities,
as will be seen by our list of synonyms, have used <i>pictus</i> and
<i>picta</i> as the specific name of the Nilgai; but, as we have
already pointed out, <i>tragocamelus</i> is prior in point of date, and
being also unquestionably applicable, should have the preference.</p>

<p>Erxleben’s name “<i>albipes</i>” and Zimmermann’s “<i>leucopus</i>,”
both founded on Pennant’s “White-footed Antelope,” have likewise been
proposed for the present species, but are also both later in date.
Again, in 1827, Hamilton Smith adopted “<i>risia</i>” as the specific
name of the Nilgai on account of some fancied objection to the term
<i>picta</i>. But in this change few have been found to follow him.
Finally, in 1836, Ogilby proposed to alter the name of the Nilgai to
<i>hippelaphus</i>, because he thought it was the true Hippelaphus of
Aristotle. This is possibly the case, but it does not necessitate the
suggested change of the specific term.</p>

<p>As regards the generic name of the Nilgai, we have fortunately only
two to choose from&mdash;<i>Boselaphus</i> of De Blainville, published in
1816, and <i>Portax</i> of Hamilton Smith, proposed in 1827. Of these
two, according to the rules of Zoological Nomenclature, we employ the
oldest; and the scientific name of the Nilgai consequently becomes
<i>Boselaphus tragocamelus</i>, as was first adopted by Sclater in 1883.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further we must call attention to the excellent
account of the Nilgai read before the Royal Society in 1774 by the
great physiologist and physician William Hunter and published, along
with an excellent figure of the animal by Stubbs, in the 61st volume
of the ‘Philosophical Transactions,’ from which we make the following
extracts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Among the riches which of late years have been imported from
India may be reckoned a fine animal, the Nyl-ghau; which, it
is to be hoped, will now be propagated in this country, so as
to become one of the most useful, or at least one of the most
ornamental beasts of the field. It is larger than any ruminant
of this country, except the ox; its flesh probably will be found
to be delicious; and, if it should prove docile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> enough to be
easily trained to labour, its great swiftness, with considerable
strength, might be applied, one would think, to valuable
purposes.</p>

<p>“Good paintings of animals give much clearer ideas than
descriptions. Whoever looks at the picture, which was done under
my eye by Mr. Stubbs, that excellent painter of animals, can
never be at a loss to know the Nyl-ghau, wherever he may happen
to meet with it. However, I shall attempt a description of the
animal; and then give as much of its history as I have been
hitherto able to learn. The account will be imperfect: yet it
will give naturalists some pleasure in the meantime to know even
a little of a large and elegant animal, which has not hitherto
been described or painted.”</p>
</div>

<p>After a capital description of both sexes of this animal from the
living specimens, Hunter proceeds as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Of late years several of this species, both male and female,
have been brought to England. The first were sent from Bombay
by Gov. Cromelen, as a present to Lord Clive: they arrived in
August 1767. They were male and female, and continued to breed
every year. Afterwards two were brought over, and presented
to the Queen by Mr. Sullivan. From Her Majesty’s desire to
encourage every useful or curious enquiry in natural knowledge,
I was permitted to keep these two for some time, which enabled
me to describe them, and to get a correct picture made, and,
with my brother’s assistance, to dissect the dead animal, and
preserve the skin and skeleton. Lord Clive has been so kind to
give me every help that he could furnish me with in making out
their history; so has General Carnac, and some other gentlemen.</p>

<p>“At all the places in India, where we have settlements, they
are rarities, brought from the distant interior parts of the
country, as presents to Nabobs and great men. Lord Clive,
General Carnac, Mr. Walsh, Mr. Watts, and many other gentlemen,
who have seen much of India, tell me they never saw them wild.
So far as I have yet found, Bernier is the only author who has
ever mentioned them.</p>

<p>“In the fourth vol. of his Mémoires, he gives an account of
a journey which he undertook, ann. 1664, from Delhi, to the
province of Cachemire, with the Mogul Aurengzeb, who went to
that terrestrial paradise, as it is esteemed by the Indians,
to avoid the heat of the summer. In giving an account of the
hunting, which was the Emperor’s amusement in this journey, he
describes, among others, that of <i>le Nyl-ghau</i>, but without
saying more of the animal than that the Emperor sometimes kills
them in such numbers as to distribute quarters of them to all
his Omrachs; which shows that they were there wild, and in
plenty, and esteemed good or delicious food.</p>

<p>“This agrees with the rarity of these animals at Bengal, Madras,
and Bombay; for Cachemire is the most northern province of the
Empire, and it was on the march from Delhi to that place that
Bernier saw the Emperor hunt them.”</p>
</div>

<p>Although, as we have already seen, living specimens of the Nilgai were
long ago brought to Europe, little addition was made to our knowledge
of this animal in its native state until the days of Elliot, Jerdon,
and Hodgson.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> In 1839 Sir Walter Elliot included the Nilgai in his
catalogue of the Mammals of the Southern Mahratta country, where he
states “it is found in the thick low jungles.” Jerdon, in his volume on
the Mammals of India, tells us that the Nilgai “frequents thin forests
and low jungles, but is also often found in tolerably open plains with
only a few scattered bushes. It associates in small herds, varying from
7 or 8 to 20 and upwards.”</p>

<p>Mr. Robert A. Sterndale, whose popular manual on the Mammals of India
and Ceylon was published in 1884, does not speak favourably of his
experience of the flesh of the Nilgai as an article of diet:&mdash;“The
Nilgao,” he says, “feeds on Beyr (<i>Zizyphus jujuba</i>) and other
trees, and at times devours such quantities of the intensely acrid
berries of the Aoula (<i>Phyllanthus emblica</i>) that its flesh
becomes saturated with the bitter elements of the fruit. This is most
noticeable in soup, less so in a steak, which is at times not bad.
The tongue and marrow-bones, however, are generally as much as the
sportsman claims, and in the Central Provinces at least the natives are
grateful for all the rest.”</p>

<p>Col. Kinloch, who writes of the Nilgai mainly from a sporting point of
view, gives us the following account of this animal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Nilgai does not hold a very high place among the
Game-animals of India, and is seldom shot by any but young
sportsmen, unless meat is required for camp-followers. It
is, however, one of the largest and most conspicuous of the
ruminants to be found in the plains, and no records of Indian
sport would be complete without some notice of it.</p>

<p>“The bull is a large and powerful beast, attaining a height of
at least 14 hands at the withers, which are high and narrow
like those of a horse. The neck is long and compressed, and
the head slender and deer-like, the eyes being remarkably full
and lustrous. The hind-quarters fall away considerably, giving
the animal rather an awkward appearance. The legs are slender
and wiry, and the hoofs rather upright. The tail is tufted,
something like that of the domestic cow, but it is not so long
in proportion, reaching only to the hocks. The color is a dark
bluish grey, deepening to nearly black in very old individuals,
while the legs are jet-black, curiously marked with white
patches about the fetlocks. The throat is white, and from the
lower part of it depends a long tuft of blackish hair, while the
hair on the withers is developed into a thin upright mane.</p>

<p>“The cow is of a light brown colour, and is destitute of horns.
The young males are like the females, but become gradually
darker with age.</p>

<p>“Nilgai inhabit extensive grass-and tree-jungles, but appear
to prefer those that are not very thick, and interspersed with
occasional bare open spaces. Their favorite cover seems to
be that composed of the ‘<i>dhák</i>’ or ‘<i>palás</i>’ tree
(<i>Butea frondosa</i>). They are also fond of resorting to the
sugar-cane fields, and they frequently commit considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
damage among cultivation. They are generally to be found in
herds, varying in number from four or five to twenty, and
composed of both sexes; but occasionally small parties of old
Blue Bulls, and even solitary bulls, are to be met with. In
places where they are not disturbed, especially in some of the
Native States, Nilgai are absurdly tame, but in districts where
they are much molested they become extremely shy and wary. It
must not therefore be supposed that they can always be easily
shot, but they afford such a poor trophy that, as already
mentioned, they are not much sought after. When they can be
found sufficiently far from thick cover, they may be speared,
and they then show capital sport; as they will probably lead a
well-mounted horseman a chase of several miles. On hard ground
I doubt if a <i>cow</i> Nilgai could be speared by a solitary
hunter; the bull, being much heavier, is more easily ridden down.</p>

  </div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The flesh of a cow Nilgai is occasionally excellent, and the
tongue and marrow-bones are supposed to be delicacies. They are,
however, hardly worth shooting, except when one is in want of
meat for Mahomedan servants: Hindoos, of course, will not touch
the flesh.”</p>

     <p class="p0 center sm">Frontlet of an adult male Nilgai.</p>
     <p class="p0 center sm">(Brit. Mus.).</p>
  </div>

<p>The Nilgai does well in captivity, and, as we have already mentioned,
several of the original descriptions of this animal by the older
writers were based on specimens brought alive to Europe. In 1824 both
sexes of the Nilgai were well figured by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and F.
Cuvier in their</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span></p>

<p>‘Histoire Naturelle des Mammifères,’ from specimens living in the
Jardin des Plantes. In 1845, as we learn from Gray, the Nilgai bred in
the Knowsley Menagerie, and there was at that time a herd of a male
and four females kept in one of the paddocks along with the Elands.
In 1847 the half-grown male and young were drawn from some of these
specimens by Waterhouse Hawkins, and the figures were published in
the twenty-ninth plate of the ‘Gleanings.’ The Nilgai has been an
inhabitant of the Zoological Society’s Menagerie from its commencement.
In 1830 it was described and figured in the first of the two volumes
on the ‘Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society’ by Vigors and
Bennett, and in February 1831, as recorded in the ‘Proceedings,’ a
specimen of a young one, born at the Society’s farm at Kingston, was
exhibited and described at one of the Scientific Meetings. This appears
to have been the first instance of its breeding in the Society’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
Gardens, but since that date many other examples have been received,
and the species has frequently bred in the Menagerie. On referring to
the Society’s registers we find that this has taken place in 1856,
1864, 1866, 1868, and 1869. As a general rule, two young ones are
produced at the same birth; but the young animals, although they
thrive well, are excessively shy and timid, as is also the case with
many others of the Deer and Antelopes, so that, if frightened, they
frequently injure themselves by rushing against the fences of their
paddocks.</p>

<p>Our coloured illustration of the Nilgai (Plate LXXXVII.) has been
prepared from specimens of both sexes of this animal now living in the
Zoological Society’s Gardens, where they were received in exchange on
October 14th, 1896.</p>

<p>There is a good mounted example of the male Nilgai in the British
Museum, obtained from the Zoological Society’s Gardens in 1896,
besides two other older mounted specimens kept in store. There are
also specimens of heads of this animal from the Khalcote jungle south
of Mhow, presented by Col. J. Evans, and from Jullunder near Sangor,
presented by Mr. G. A. Carmichael, and some skulls and horns from Oude
and the North-west Provinces, presented by Mr. A. O. Hume, C.B. From
the last of these the drawings of the skull and horns and frontlet of
an adult male (figs. 98 and 99) have been prepared.</p>

</div>

<p>Like many other characteristic animals of North-eastern Africa, the
present Antelope was one of the discoveries of the great explorer
and naturalist Rüppell, who first described it in his volume upon
new Mammals from Abyssinia which contained the results of his
long investigations in that country. Rüppell called this species
“<i>decula</i>,” from the Latin transliteration of its Amharic native
name, remarking at the same time that this word must not be confounded
with “<i>thecula</i>,” which is the Abyssinian name for the Hunting-dog
(<i>Lycaon pictus</i>). He remarks that the species belongs to the
subgenus <i>Tragelaphus</i> of Blainville, and is closely allied to
<i>T. sylvaticus</i> of the Cape, from which it is distinguishable
by its smaller size and different colouring. Rüppell obtained a good
series of this Antelope, and gives excellent descriptions of the adult
male, the adult female, the two-year-old male, and the newly-born calf.
He met with it in the bushy valleys of Central Abyssinia, round the
lake of Dembea or Tana, where it feeds principally on small leaves of
trees, and is said to be specially fond of the ripe fallen fruits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span> of
the sycamore fig-tree. The Deculas pair in the month of May in this
district, and produce their young ones in October. They are very quick
and shy, but are occasionally hunted by the natives with dogs. Their
flesh, according to Rüppell, is not particularly palatable.</p>

<p>The only other African explorer that appears to have come across this
Antelope in its native wilds is Heuglin, who, however, does not favour
us with a very distinct account of his experiences of it. In his
memoir on the Antelopes and Buffaloes of North-east Africa, published
in 1863, Heuglin states that the range of this species extends over
the districts of Upper Nubia bordering on Abyssinia, Galabat, the
River Settite, and Takeh. He also gives a figure of the skull of a
specimen obtained by him, which he points out differs slightly in the
shape of the horns from that figured by Rüppell and in some other
particulars. In a subsequent work (‘Reise in Nordost-Afrika’) Heuglin
has described what he considered to be possibly a different animal
(although closely allied to the Abyssinian <i>T. decula</i>) from the
banks of the White Nile, where it is called by the Djengs “<i>Bor</i>,”
in Bonga “<i>Towa</i>,” and by the Dgurs “<i>Burah</i>.” This Antelope
he met with in pairs amongst the high grass and thick bushes of
<i>Bauhinia</i> and <i>Acacia</i>-trees in the above-named districts.
In case of its proving different from <i>T. decula</i> he proposed to
designate it <i>Tragelaphus bor</i>.</p>

<p>As will be seen by our subsequent remarks, it is not quite certain
which of the species of this group of <i>Tragelaphus</i> occurs on the
White Nile. It may be either the present <i>T. decula</i> or one of the
forms of <i>T. scriptus</i>.</p>

<p>In the British Museum there is a skin of an immature male of this
species, together with its skull, belonging to the series obtained by
Rüppell in Abyssinia. There are also in the National Collection an
adult mounted male and female from the Upper Atbara obtained in 1874
and 1876.</p>

<p>Our illustration (Plate LXXXVIII.), which was put upon the stone by Mr.
Smit from a sketch prepared by Mr. Wolf under the directions of the
late Sir Victor Brooke, is believed to have been taken from the mounted
specimens in the British Museum.</p>

<p>So far as we know, no examples of this form of the Bushbuck have ever
been brought to Europe alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span></p>

<p>The Bushbucks of the typical section of the genus <i>Tragelaphus</i>
appear to be spread all over Africa south of the Sahara, wherever
wooded districts suitable for their mode of life are met with. But
although they are all nearly similar in general structure they vary
much in their markings and other minor characters, and it is an
exceedingly difficult task to decide how far these differences should
be regarded as specific or subspecific, or in some cases as merely
individual variations. A much larger series of specimens from the
various localities in the wide area over which this animal ranges
than we can yet command is necessary before any certain conclusions
can be arrived at on this subject. Meanwhile we propose to follow, as
probably approximately correct, the view already put forward on this
group by Thomas in his article on the <i>Tragelaphi</i>, published
in the Zoological Society’s ‘Proceedings’ for 1891, merely elevating
the four forms there treated of as subspecies to the rank of species.
Of these four species thus recognized we have already treated of
one&mdash;<i>Tragelaphus decula</i>, which appears to be a somewhat
isolated form only met with in Abyssinia and the immediately adjacent
districts. We have now come to the true <i>T. scriptus</i>, which, on
the contrary, seems to have a very wide distribution under its various
phases.</p>

<p>The “Harnessed Antelope,” as it is usually called in English, was
first discovered in Senegal by the celebrated naturalist and traveller
Adanson, who visited that Colony in the middle of the last century,
and communicated many of his notes and specimens to Buffon. The latter
described and figured it in his ‘Histoire Naturelle’ under the name
“<i>Le Guib</i>” which Adanson gave as its native name in Senegal,
stating that it is found in the woods and plains of the country of the
Jaloufs and on the Senegal River. From Senegal also living specimens of
both sexes of this Antelope were subsequently received at the Jardin
des Plantes, and figured under the same name by F. Cuvier and Geoffroy
St.-Hilaire in their great work upon Mammals. Pallas established his
“<i>Antilope scripta</i>” upon Buffon’s “<i>Guib</i>,” stating that
he had not himself met with examples of it. There can be no doubt,
therefore, that this particular local form is entitled to be called
<i>Tragelaphus scriptus</i>. Like most of the Senegalese mammals, it
also occurs on the Gambia, where Whitfield, and, in more recent days,
Dr. Rendall procured specimens which are now in the British Museum.</p>

<p>Descending the West-African coast we find the same species also
recorded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> from Liberia, where Herr Büttikofer and his fellow-explorers
of that Republic, as recorded by Dr. Jentink, met with it in many
localities and obtained a good series of specimens of it for the Leyden
Museum.</p>

<p>In his ‘Reisebilder aus Liberia’ Büttikofer tells us that this Antelope
is universally known to the Liberians as the “Red Deer,” and is found
wherever the forest is interspersed with meadows and plantations. Its
palatable meat is often brought to the market in Moravia. It is the
more easily obtained by the hunter because it is by no means shy, and
often comes to feed into the vegetable-gardens adjoining the planters’
dwellings. It is also frequently caught alive, and does well in
captivity.</p>

<p>Pel, another well-known collector for the Leyden Museum, obtained for
that institution examples of this Antelope on the Gold Coast, and there
are specimens of it in the British Museum from Fantee, and from Mount
Victoria in the Cameroons. We may therefore consider it established
that the typical form of <i>Tragelaphus scriptus</i> is found all along
the wooded districts of Western Africa from the Senegal River to the
Cameroons. But as we proceed further south soon after this a slight
alteration in the characters of this Antelope begins to appear.</p>

<p>Hamilton Smith, writing in Griffith’s ‘Animal Kingdom’ in 1827, was the
first to notice differences in the specimens of this species from the
Congo, which had been sent home by Tuckey’s Expedition, and proposed
to name the Congo form <i>Antilope phalerata</i>. M. Pousargues, who
has recently published an excellent essay on the Mammals of French
Congo-land, informs us that only one of three specimens of this
Antelope received at Paris from that country presented the special
difference upon which Hamilton Smith mainly based his species&mdash;that
is, the absence of the longitudinal white stripe on the shoulder and
flanks,&mdash;and states his opinion that this character is of no systematic
value. This opinion is supported by the fact that in one of the two
bucks, referred to later on, from Senegambia, now living in the
Society’s Gardens, the stripe in question is very conspicuous, whereas
in the other it is faintly defined and very short. It is significant,
too, that the latter animal is the larger and apparently the older of
the two. Hence it is not unlikely that the stripe tends to disappear in
old individuals and that the type of <i>T. phaleratus</i> was nothing
but an aged example of <i>T. scriptus</i>. However that may be, our
knowledge of the Congo form is too incomplete to admit of our regarding
it as distinct from the typical Senegambian <i>T. scriptus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span></p>

<p>Further to the south, in the valley of the Chobé and Upper Zambesi,
<i>T. scriptus</i> is again met with, but under a modified form,
which may for the present be regarded as a distinct subspecies. This
animal was first discovered by Mr. Chapman on the Botletlie River,
and subsequently on the Chobé by Mr. Selous, who described it in his
‘Hunter’s Wanderings’ and in the Zoological Society’s ‘Proceedings’
for 1881. Mr. Selous, in response to an inquiry on this point, kindly
informs us that he has never seen a skin either of adult or young of
the Chobé Bushbuck marked with an upper longitudinal white stripe; and
we learn from his published observations on this animal, and from the
skins of it that are now in the British Museum, that the females and
young are much less strongly striped and spotted with white than are
the adult males.</p>

<p>This does not appear to be the case as regards the typical <i>T.
scriptus</i>; and although the entire absence of the upper white band
in the form from the Chobé suggests the possibility of identity between
it and the form from the Congo, we know nothing of the characters of
the females and young of the latter to justify us in assigning the name
<i>phaleratus</i> to the subspecies first figured and described by Mr.
Selous. The animal for which we propose to adopt Mr. Pocock’s name
<i>T. scriptus ornatus</i> may be described as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Male adult.</i> General characters as in <i>T. scriptus</i>.
Height at withers of adult male about 28 inches. Colour dark
red, with as many as seven or eight transverse white stripes,
about six white spots on the shoulders, and as many as twenty
on the hind-quarters, and a line of white spots passing
longitudinally above the belly. Belly, chest, and limbs on outer
side down to knees and hocks blackish. Face deep greyish fawn,
with very faint white eye-spots. A dorsal crest of long white
hairs extending from the shoulder to the root of the tail.</p>

<p><i>Young male.</i> Pale reddish yellow, with spots and stripes
much more faintly marked.</p>

<p><i>Female.</i> Smaller than male, chestnut in colour, marked
with only three or four faint white stripes and with fewer spots
than in the other sex; belly reddish yellow, paler than the
sides of the body; outer side of limbs chestnut above and below
the knees and hocks.</p>

<p><i>Young female.</i> Lighter red and less spotted than adult.</p>
</div>

<p>At the end of our list of synonyms of the typical form of this
Antelope it will be observed that we have added, with a mark of doubt,
<i>Tragelaphus gratus</i> of Rochebrune’s ‘Faune de la Sénégambie,’
upon which Dr. Trouessart has based his <i>Tragelaphus obscurus</i>.
All that can be said of Rochebrune’s figure is that, if correctly
drawn, it cannot have been taken from <i>Limnotragus gratus</i>,
which is at once recognizable by its elongated hoofs, and that it is
<i>more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span> likely</i> to have been based on an example of the present
species. But we have already on more than one occasion alluded to the
untrustworthiness of Dr. Rochebrune’s work, and think it hardly worth
while to discuss the subject further.</p>

<p>The Harnessed Antelope is frequently brought alive to Europe from the
ports on the West Coast of Africa and does nicely in captivity. It was
well represented in the great Knowsley Menagerie, where it frequently
bred. In May 1845, as we learn from the ‘Gleanings,’ there was at
Knowsley a herd of two males and four females, of which three were
then expected to produce young. Both sexes were figured by Waterhouse
Hawkins on the 28th plate of that work. Several specimens of it were
sold at the dispersal of the Knowsley Menagerie in 1851.</p>

<p>The Zoological Society of London has exhibited specimens of this
handsome Antelope ever since its gardens were instituted, but it does
not appear to have bred there. Dr. Percy Rendall, F.Z.S., brought home
a fine male from the Gambia in 1890, and in the following year a pair
was presented to the Society by Sir R. B. Llewelyn, K.C.M.G., the
Governor of that Colony. In Mr. Smit’s illustration of this species
(Plate LXXXIX.) the figures of the male and female were taken from the
Zoological Society’s specimens; the young one in the front was drawn
from a specimen from Fantee, in the British Museum.</p>

</div>

<p>The Bushbuck, so named by the Dutch settlers at the Cape from its
being an inhabitant of the forest (<i>bosch</i>), was first made
known to science by the famous Swedish traveller and naturalist
Sparrman, who obtained specimens of it during his expedition to the
Cape, and described it on his return home in the ‘Acta Holmiensia,’
and subsequently in the several editions of his ‘Travels.’ Sparrman
specially mentions Groot Vaders-bosch and Houtniquas-bosch, in the
south of the Colony, as the districts in which he had encountered this
Antelope.</p>

<p>The Bushbuck was also described and figured by Buffon in the
‘Supplement’ to his ‘Histoire Naturelle’ from information received from
Allamand and first published in Schneider’s edition of the ‘Histoire
Naturelle’ issued at Amsterdam. It was likewise mentioned by Thunberg,
Lichtenstein, and other earlier writers, who adopted Sparrman’s
scientific name for it. Little of moment, however, is added to our
knowledge of its habits and range until we come to Harris’s illustrated
volume on the ‘Game-Animals of Southern Africa,’ published in 1840.
In this work a special chapter is devoted to an account of the sport
of hunting the Bushbuck along with the Grysbok and the Blue Duiker,
which are all figured together in the twenty-sixth plate of Harris’s
‘Portraits.’ This author discourses eloquently on the first-named
Antelope as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Aptly enough has this elegant and game-looking Antelope been
designated the ‘Bush-goat’; since, concealing itself during
the day in the deepest glens of the wooded mountains, it quits
not its retreat except during the matin hours, when it warily
sallies forth to graze along the outskirts of the forest, or
tempted by the bright moonlight nights, makes a foray upon the
neighbouring gardens and cultivation. Slow of foot, and easily
overtaken if surprised in open situations, it is wise to lie
thus close in its native jungles, the thickest of which it
traverses with ease&mdash;darting from one shrubbery to another,
and forcing its elastic form through the plaited undergrowth,
with its horns so crouched along the neck as to prevent their
impeding progress by becoming entangled in the sylvan labyrinth.
So perfectly does the voice of this singular species counterfeit
the barking of a dog that the benighted wayfarer is said to
have been decoyed by it into the most lonely depths of the
forest, vainly hoping to discover some human habitation, whereas
every step has but removed him further from the abodes of man.
Combining singular elegance and vigour with the most marked and
decided colouring, the Bushbuck stands quite by itself among
the Antelopes of Southern Africa, and is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span> be found only in
those parts of the Colony and of Caffraria where sufficient
cover exists to afford it a safe asylum. Naturally preferring
solitude, the buck is nevertheless frequently found in the
society of the doe, accompanied during the breeding-season by
one or two kids, but never by adult individuals. Every specimen
that I have seen displayed a bare ring around the neck, from
which, by some process not satisfactorily explained, the hair
had been removed as if through long confinement by a chain and
collar. Very old subjects wear white stockings, gartered above
the knee, and it is usual to find a narrow white tape along the
back, partially concealed by the goat-like mane which bristles
from the ridge of the spine. But of these characters none are
constant, all being often absent in the female, and even in
the non-adult male, whose lighter coloured coats are never so
prominently ‘picked out’ as the dark robes of the patriarchs.”</p>
</div>

<p>Messrs. Nicolls and Eglington, in their ‘Sportsman in South Africa,’
inform us that at the present time the Bushbuck is still plentiful in
all the maritime divisions of the Cape Colony and Natal, wherever there
are any considerable belts of thick bush. It is not usual to find more
than a pair of adults together, and the animals seldom emerge from
the impenetrable bush except at night-time, when they come out into
the open glades to feed. The bare patches on the neck alluded to by
Harris are explained by these authors to be caused by the horns being
constantly thrown backwards along the neck, which thus becomes denuded
of hair.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Port Elizabeth we are told, and in other
districts of the Colony, the Bushbuck is very strictly preserved, and
battues are held every year about Easter-time, when large drives of
them take place. Numbers of natives are employed with the assistance of
dogs to beat the wooded kloofs, and to drive the game towards the guns,
which are placed in the narrow necks of the valleys. Excellent sport is
thus obtained.</p>

<p>When we proceed as far up the coast as the Limpopo the Cape Bushbuck,
as we shall presently more fully explain, is replaced by Cumming’s
Bushbuck (<i>Tragelaphus roualeyni</i>). In this Bushbuck, as Mr.
Selous informs us, the adult rams are of a brownish grey, often without
a sign of any spots, and the adult females of a dark red with a few
white spots. The young rams, however, are of a red colour and a good
deal spotted, and have a few faint transverse stripes, while the young
females are also more spotted than the old ones. If, however, Mr.
Selous continues, we examine the Bushbucks found on the Zambesi to
the east of the Victoria Falls, the adult rams are in colour like the
young rams of the Limpopo, being of a dark red thickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span> spotted on the
haunches, shoulders, and sides with small white spots, with three or
four faint white stripes down each side. On the other hand, if we take
the Bushbucks found on the banks of the Chobé and in the country to the
west of the Victoria Falls we find an animal of a very dark red colour,
most beautifully spotted with large white spots, and ornamented in some
cases with as many as eight well-defined white stripes and a long mane
of white hair. This Bushbuck of the Chobé is that which, following Mr.
Pocock, we have called <i>Tragelaphus scriptus ornatus</i> (v. s. p.
110).</p>

<p>On the whole, there seems to be little doubt that there are
intermediate forms between what we have here treated of as three
species of Bushbuck, but the question is by no means finally settled,
and waits for a better and larger series of specimens than is at our
command before a satisfactory conclusion can be arrived at.</p>

<p>The Cape Bushbuck does well in captivity, and is frequently brought
to Europe. Living specimens of it may often be seen in the principal
Zoological Gardens. The first example possessed by the Zoological
Society of London appears to have been acquired in April 1859, when it
was presented by the late Sir George Grey. Other specimens arrived in
1881 and 1887, and the Society has lately received good examples of it
presented by its excellent correspondents Mr. J. E. Matcham of Port
Elizabeth and Mr. W. Champion of Natal.</p>

<p>Our illustration of this species (Plate XC. fig. 2) was prepared by
Mr. Smit from one of the specimens living in the Zoological Society’s
Gardens in May of the present year.</p>

<p>The typical form of this species is very nearly allied to the Bushbuck
of the Cape Colony (<i>T. sylvaticus</i>), but is more strongly marked
with white. Colour variable. Adult bucks sometimes nearly black or
brownish grey, without traces of stripes and spots; sometimes marked
with a few faint stripes and a few spots.</p>

<p>Females and immature males are redder in colour than adult bucks, and
generally weakly striped and spotted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Hab.</i> From the Limpopo River across the Lower Zambesi to
Nyasaland, and thence northwards to British East Africa and
Somaliland.</p>
</div>

<p>The great sportsman Roualeyn Gordon Cumming was the first observer
of this East-African form of the Bushbuck, and with characteristic
audacity named it after himself. He seems to have first met with it on
the Limpopo in June 1847, and in his ‘Hunter’s Life’ has given us the
following account of his discovery:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was in a sequestered bend of the river, where the banks for
several acres were densely clad with lofty reeds and grass which
towered above my head as I sat on my horse’s back. Beyond the
reeds and grass were trees of all sizes, forming a dense shade;
this is the general character of the Limpopo, as far as I have
yet seen. I was slowly returning to my camp, in anything but
good humour at my want of success with the game I had just been
after, when, behold, an antelope of the most exquisite beauty,
and utterly unknown to sportsmen or naturalists, stood broadside
in my path, looking me full in the face. It was a princely
old buck of the ‘<i>Serolomootlooque</i>’ of the Bakalahari,
or ‘Bushbuck of the Limpopo.’ He carried a very fine wide-set
pair of horns. On beholding him I was struck with wonder and
delight. My heart beat with excitement. I sprang from my saddle,
but before I could fire a shot this gem of beauty bounded into
the reeds and was lost to my sight. At that moment I would have
given half what I possessed in this world for a broadside at
that lovely antelope, and I at once resolved not to proceed
farther on my expedition until I had captured him, although it
should cost me the labour of a month.</p>

<p>“The antelope having entered the reeds, I gave my horse to my
after-rider, and with my rifle on full cock and at the ready I
proceeded to stalk with extreme caution throughout the length
and breadth of the cover; but I stalked in vain; the antelope
had vanished, and was nowhere to be found. I then returned
to my steed and rode slowly up the river’s bank towards my
camp. I had ridden to within a few hundred yards of the
wagons, and was meditating how I should best circumvent the
<i>Serolomootlooque</i>, when once more this lovely antelope
crossed my path; I had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span> unwittingly driving him before me
along the bank of the river. He trotted like a roebuck into the
thick cover and then stood broadside among the thorn bushes. I
sprang from my saddle, and guessing about his position, I fired
and missed him; he then trotted along a rhinoceros’s footpath,
and gave me a second chance. Again I fired, and before my rifle
was down from my shoulder the <i>Serolomootlooque</i> lay
prostrate in the dust. The ball had cut the skin open along his
ribs, and entering his body had passed along his neck, and had
lodged in his brains, where we found it on preparing the head
for stuffing. I was not a little gratified at my good fortune
in securing this novel and valuable trophy; he was one of the
most perfect antelopes I had ever beheld, both in symmetry and
colour. I had him immediately conveyed to camp, where I took
his measurement, and wrote out a correct description of him for
the benefit of naturalists. I christened him the ‘<i>Antelopus
roualeynei</i>,’ or ‘Bushbuck of the Limpopo.’”</p>
</div>

<p>It is not, however, without considerable hesitation that we have
decided to retain Cumming’s name for the form of Bushbuck that, as
will be presently seen, extends from the Limpopo River northwards to
British East Africa and Somaliland. Although, according to Selous, the
Bushbucks that are found on the Zambesi to the east of the Victoria
Falls differ from those inhabiting the Limpopo (that is to say, from
the typical <i>roualeyni</i>) in being of a dark red colour, thickly
spotted on the haunches, shoulders, and sides, and marked with three
or four faint white stripes, whereas the adult of the Limpopo form is
a dark brownish grey, not striped, and often without a sign of spots,
we venture to think there is sufficient evidence to show that these
distinctions will not hold good when more material from the two rivers
has been examined. For example, a fine series of skins of bucks of
various ages sent by Sir Harry Johnston from Nyasaland, and presumably
identical with the form observed by Selous on the Lower Zambesi,
shows considerable variation in colour. The young male is yellowish
red throughout, with about half-a-dozen spots on the hind-quarters
and scarcely a trace of stripes. The adult is of a richer yellowish
red, brighter on the hind-quarters, and passing into black on the
shoulders, belly, and base of the neck, with a few white spots on the
hind-quarters, and occasionally also on the shoulder, and sometimes
a row of spots along the sides above the belly. Sometimes there are
about three indistinct white stripes on each side, sometimes only one;
but more often there are no traces of them to be seen, the presence
or absence of the stripes being apparently independent of age. As we
pass northwards into East Africa from Nyasaland the stripes, judging
from accounts given by sportsmen and naturalists, seem to become more
persistent, and in a mounted example in the British Museum, obtained
on Manda Island, opposite Witu,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> by Sir John Kirk, as will be seen by
Mr. Smit’s figure of this specimen (Plate XC. fig. 1), they are plainly
visible. This specimen stands about 32 inches at the withers, and its
horns surpass 14 inches in length, so there is no doubt as to its
maturity. On the whole, the most reasonable course to pursue seems to
be, at least for the present, to refer all the specimens met with in
Eastern Africa, from the Limpopo to the Shebeyli, to one species.</p>

<p>We will now say a few words as to what the principal writers who have
met with this Bushbuck in the more northern portion of its range have
recorded of its habits and distribution. Mr. Crawshay, one of our best
authorities on the Antelopes of Nyasaland, tells us that it is the
commonest of all the Antelopes of that country. From the great variety
that exists in the colour and markings of the Nyasan Bushbucks, Mr.
Crawshay thought at first there must be more than one species; but
after carefully examining a great many of both sexes, young and old, he
came to the conclusion that there is only one, of the various stages of
which he gives minute descriptions.</p>

     <p class="p0 center sm">(Brit. Mus.)</p>
  </div>

<p>Sir Harry Johnston, in his ‘British Central Africa,’ gives us an
excellent figure of the male Bushbuck, which he says is extremely
common throughout the Protectorate. He describes its flesh as without
exception the most delicious eating of any mammal in the world,
“surpassing in tenderness and flavour that of the best Welsh mutton, or
of any kind of venison.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>

<p>In German East Africa, Herr Matschie informs us that Cumming’s Bushbuck
is also found all over the country, generally in the immediate
neighbourhood of water, where it resorts to the thickest bush on
the banks. Herr Matschie also gives a good figure of <i>Tragelaphus
roualeyni</i>, in which, however, no traces of transverse bands are
perceptible.</p>

<p>In British East Africa this Antelope, according to Mr. F. J. Jackson,
is also common everywhere on the coast, and is to be met with as far
west as the edge of the Mau Plateau, where, as he informs us (P. Z. S.
1897, p. 456), it is plentiful.</p>

     <p class="p0 center sm">(Brit. Mus.)</p>
  </div>

<p>Further north in Somaliland the Bushbuck, although not met with
anywhere on the high plateau, was found in the dense forests of the
Webbe by Capt. Swayne during his second expedition in 1893. It is
described by him as the most wary and difficult to shoot of all the
game-animals he has ever encountered. It is often caught by the natives
on the Webbe in staked pits, excavated in the jungles on the banks of
the river.</p>

<p>Capt. Swayne has referred the Bushbuck of the Webbe to <i>T.
decula</i>, but this is certainly not correct, as, according to his
own description, it has “four or five white stripes, and sometimes as
many as thirty white spots.” In some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> skins from Sen Morettu, on the
Webbe, received from Capt. Swayne, now in the British Museum, there
are four or five distinct white stripes on the flanks, both in adult
and immature males, a few white spots on the hind-quarters, and a row
of white spots extending along each side of the body above the belly.
Although in some respects this form comes nearer to <i>T. scriptus</i>,
we think it better for the present to regard it as a subspecific form
of <i>T. roualeyni</i>, which, using Mr. Pocock’s subspecific term, we
call <i>T. roualeyni fasciatus</i>, and describe as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Height at withers about 26 inches. Head and legs of the same
colour and pattern as in <i>T. roualeyni</i> and the other
species of this section of the genus. General colour a reddish
yellow, brighter on the hind-quarters, and distinctly blacker in
the dorsal region, where the hair assumes a dusky greyish-brown
hue. Body marked with four or five very distinct, mostly broad,
white stripes, a row of white spots running along above the
belly and a few white spots on the haunches. Hair on body
shorter than in <i>T. roualeyni</i>. No distinct collar of short
hair round the base of the neck, as in <i>T. roualeyni, T.
sylvaticus</i>, and <i>T. scriptus</i>, the entire neck being
covered with a coating of short silky hairs of the same length
as those of the head, much shorter than those of the body, and
of a dusky, greyish-brown colour.</p>

<p>Young male redder in colour than the adult and equally strongly
marked with white.</p>

<p>The skull of a subadult male gives the following
measurements:&mdash;Basal length 8·25 inches, orbit to muzzle 4·6,
greatest width 3·75.</p>
</div>

<p>In the British Museum are a skull of the typical <i>T. roualeyni</i>
of the Limpopo, procured by Gordon Cumming, and a skin and skull from
the Zambesi obtained by Mr. Selous. There is also in the Museum a good
series of skins and skulls of this species from Zomba, Nyasaland, and
its vicinity, transmitted by Sir Harry Johnston and Mr. A. Sharpe, of
which we have already spoken, and from one of which our figures of the
adult skull (pp. 126, 127) have been taken. From British East Africa
the National Collection possesses the mounted adult male from Manda
Island presented by Sir John Kirk (and figured on our Plate XC., as
already mentioned), also a mounted female from the same source obtained
in British East Africa about one hundred miles inland at 6° S. lat.
Besides these there are Capt. Swayne’s specimens from the River Webbe
in the interior of Somaliland, already referred to.</p>

<p>We are not aware that any examples of this Bushbuck have been brought
to Europe alive.</p>

<span class="subhed1"><i>Tragelaphus delamerei</i>, <b>Pocock</b>, Ann. &amp; Mag. N. H., Jan. 1900.</span></h4>

<p>Of about the same size as <i>T. scriptus</i>. Head ruddy brown on the
forehead, with a blackish band extending down the muzzle; cheeks fawn,
with two small white spots; no white stripe running inwards from the
corner of the eye; edge of upper lip and chin white; white patches at
upper and lower ends of throat small, the former only just traceable.
General colour of body dark yellowish brown above, paler below, and
gradually passing into yellowish fawn upon the shoulder and upon the
lower half of the hind-quarters. No traces of white stripes or spots
observable either upon the body or upon the hind-or fore-quarters. Fore
legs both outside and inside right up to the base yellowish brown,
blackish all down the front from above the knee to the fetlocks;
fetlocks and pasterns black, except for a pair of white spots on the
pasterns in front. Hind legs coloured like fore legs, but paler above
the hock and marked with a distinct white patch in front of the hock.
Tail white below, dark at the tip. A collar of short hairs round the
base of the neck. No long crest of hairs along the spine.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Hab.</i> Somaliland.</p>
</div>

<p>A single nearly adult example of this species (fig. 102, p. 130),
remarkable for the absence of white on the inner sides of the legs
and on the body, was procured by Lord Delamere on his last sporting
expedition into Somaliland at a place called “Sayer,” and was kindly
presented by him to the British Museum.</p>

<p>The specimen in question was examined by the person who skinned it
for Lord Delamere, and, according to his evidence, was ascertained to
be of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span> <i>male</i> sex. But in the face of its bearing no traces
of horns we are hardly disposed to accept this statement, which may
well have been made in error. Even, however, if we take it to be the
<i>female</i> of a <i>Tragelaphus</i>, we are unable to refer it to any
known species, and we therefore insert it in what would seem to be its
proper place under the name attached to it by Mr. Pocock.</p>

<p>Height at the withers of the adult male about 43 inches. General colour
of the head and body bright chestnut, with a white spinal stripe
extending from the withers to the root of the tail, and about 14 or 15
transverse white stripes on the shoulders, flanks, and hind-quarters,
passing from the spinal stripe above on to the belly beneath. Head with
a patch of deeper colour upon the forehead, and extending about two
inches below the eyes. An angular <b>V</b>-shaped white mark extending
inwards from the eye on to the nose, interrupted in the middle line
by a narrow brown band; chin and lips white; two or three cheek-spots
large and sometimes fused together; inter-ramal area and upper end of
throat covered with hairs of a blackish hue; lower end of the throat
with a very distinct transverse white band; chest and belly covered
with short hair of a purplish-brown colour; area between the hind legs
and beneath the tail up to the anus white. Fore legs blackish from
the fetlocks to the knees, chestnut from the knees to the shoulders
externally; white at the bases close to the chest, as also above the
knees and between knees and fetlocks internally; a large white spot
on the front of the pasterns. Hind legs chestnut down to the fetlocks
on the outer side; front of the hocks and cannon-bones broadly white;
fetlocks blackish or brownish, both without and within; a white patch
on the pasterns as on the fore legs.</p>

<p>Hair short and close all over the body. No mane on the throat; hairs
along the nape reversed, but scarcely forming a mane, being merely
slightly elongated; behind the parting there is a short spinal mane.
Tail bovine, thinly covered with hairs of the same colour as those of
the body, and ending in a tuft of long hairs of a darker red tint<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>Horns massive, rather smooth, with weak anterior basal crest,
amber-yellow tip, and a single twist; usually about 30 inches long
round the curve and about 25 in a straight line. A skull gives the
following measurements:&mdash;Basal length 14·5 inches, orbit to muzzle 8·5,
greatest width 6·25.</p>

<p><i>Female.</i> Similar to the male in markings, but without horns, and
rather paler in colour and smaller in size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span></p>

<p>Whether the horn from Sierra Leone, figured and described by Afzelius
in his essay on Antelopes, published in the ‘Nova Acta’ of the Society
of Sciences of Upsala in 1795, and subsequently referred to by Hamilton
Smith and other authors, really belonged to the present species is
somewhat uncertain, although such may very possibly have been the
case. The first trustworthy introduction of this species to scientific
literature is therefore due to Ogilby, a well-known authority on the
Ruminants, who in 1836 established his <i>Antilope eurycerus</i> in a
paper read before the Zoological Society of London on November the 22nd
of that year. Ogilby’s materials consisted of “two pairs of horns, one
attached to the skull, the other to the integuments of the head,” which
had then “long existed in the Society’s collection.” Their origin was
unknown, but they were believed to have come from Western Africa. These
specimens, we may add, are now in the British Museum, to which they
were transferred by the Zoological Society in 1858. One of the pairs
was figured by Gray in the volume of the ‘Gleanings from the Knowsley
Menagerie,’ published in 1850.</p>

<p>In 1853 Temminck recorded the existence of a pair of horns of this
species in the Leyden Museum, and gave its vernacular name as the
“Trommé” of the Mandingos of Western Africa.</p>

<p>With this exception no addition appears to have been made to our
knowledge of this Antelope until 1860, when Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu, who
had met with it during his excursions in the interior of Gaboon from
1856 to 1859, described it before the Boston Society of Natural History
as a new species, under the name <i>Tragelaphus albo-virgatus</i>. In
the report of his paper published in the ‘Proceedings’ of that Society
we find its locality given as the “forests about the head-waters of the
Fernand-Vaz in the Aschankolo Mountains, 60 miles south of the Equator,
and 140 from the coast.” In the narrative of his travels, published
in 1861, Mr. Du Chaillu writes of the same Antelope as belonging to
the fauna of the “Rembo Region,” the Rembo being one of the rivers
that flows from these mountains, and tells us that it is “very shy,
swift of foot, and exceedingly graceful in its motions.” The full-page
steel engraving that accompanies these remarks, which, by the kindness
of Messrs. Murray, we are enabled to reproduce (fig. 103, p. 134),
is stated to have been taken from a well-preserved specimen in his
collection. The native name is given as “Bongo.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span></p>

<p>After describing his specimens in America, Mr. Du Chaillu brought them
to this country, and disposed of them to the British Museum.</p>

  </div>

<p>The late Dr. J. E. Gray, who was not very friendly with the great
explorer, and had carried on a paper warfare with him in the ‘Athenæum’
journal, lost no time in bringing the specimens before the Zoological
Society, where he subjected them to a somewhat severe criticism.
The supposed new species of <i>Tragelaphus</i>, he pointed out, was
“evidently only a specimen of <i>Antilope eurycerus</i> of Ogilby.”
This was, no doubt, correct, but at the same time Mr. Du Chaillu’s
skin, imperfect as it was, was the first specimen of the animal, except
the original two pairs of horns, acquired by the National<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span> Collection,
where it is now to be seen mounted in the Gallery, and allows an idea
to be formed of the brilliant colours of this splendid Antelope. It
will be found figured by Sir Victor Brooke, from a sketch by Wolf (put
upon the stone by Smit), in the Zoological Society’s ‘Proceedings’ for
1871. In the same article, is given a figure of the skull and horns
of this Antelope, taken from one of the type specimens in the British
Museum, which, by the kind permission of the Zoological Society, we are
enabled to reproduce on the present occasion (fig. 104).</p>

<p>Besides Mr. Du Chaillu, the only travellers who have met with this
beautiful Antelope in its native wilds appear to have been Messrs.
Büttikofer and Stampfli, during their well-known researches in Liberia.
From Dr. Jentink’s article upon the mammals collected during their
explorations we learn that these naturalists obtained a complete
specimen of an adult male of this species near Hill Town, besides two
skins on the Junk River and the Mahfa River. In the second volume of
his ‘Reisebilder aus Liberia’ Herr Büttikofer gives a figure of the
Antelope in the text, and informs us that it lives in the forests and
feeds principally upon leaves of trees, on which it browses up to a
height of eight feet.</p>

<p>Besides the typical specimens of Ogilby’s <i>Antilope eurycerus</i>
and Du Chaillu’s <i>Tragelaphus albo-virgatus</i>, which, as already
mentioned, are now in the British Museum, the National Collection
contains a good mounted head of an adult male of this Antelope from
Fantee, which is accompanied by a flat body-skin, and the mounted
skeleton of an adult male from Gaboon.</p>

<p>We are not aware that any living examples of the Broad-horned Antelope
have ever reached Europe.</p>

<p>Our figure of this species (Plate XCI.) has been drawn by Mr. Smit from
the mounted specimen in the British Museum.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> South-eastern Africa, from Zululand to Southern
Nyasaland.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span></p>

<p>The discoverer of this fine Antelope, the late Mr. George French Angas,
was an accomplished artist and traveller, and the author of several
books on Africa and Australia. Angas first met with this species
on the northern shores of St. Lucia Bay, in Zululand, during his
journeyings in that district in 1847. Here, he tells us, it inhabits
the low undulating hills, scattered with mimosa-bushes, which border
the northern shores of the Bay. On returning to England, Angas showed
his notes and sketches of this Antelope to the late Dr. Gray, who
assured him of its being an animal new to science, and communicated
them to the Zoological Society of London in the name of the discoverer.
Angas was not successful in obtaining specimens for himself, as the
Boers, he tells us, refused to part with them, and the two plates
which illustrate his paper in the Zoological Society’s ‘Proceedings’
were lithographed by Waterhouse Hawkins from his notes and sketches.
It should also be mentioned that the Antelope was named, not after
Angas himself, but after his father, Mr. George Fife Angas, of South
Australia, who, we are told, had always “taken great interest” in his
son’s travels and researches in natural history. In a folio work called
‘Kaffirs Illustrated,’ published in 1849, Angas again figured this
Antelope, on a plate containing representations of the male, female,
and young, but did not furnish any further particulars concerning its
life and habits.</p>

<p>The next observer of Angas’ Antelope in its native wilds appears to
have been a well-known hunter, Proudfoot, who met with it on the banks
of the Maputa River, about sixty miles above its embochure into Delagoa
Bay, and exhibited specimens of both sexes, shot by himself, at a
meeting of the Zoological Society of London on July 9th, 1851. On the
Maputa, Mr. Proudfoot stated, on exhibiting his specimens, that the
<i>Inyala</i>, as the natives call it, was at that time more plentiful
than on the Umcoozi or Umbelozi, in the same district, where it was
found, though rarely. “They occur in small troops composed of one ram
and four or five females, with their young: they always resort to the
densest bush, and browse chiefly on shrubs.”</p>

<p>In June 1854 the well-known African sportsman, William Charles Baldwin,
was in Amatonga-land, on a hunting expedition from Natal. On the 25th
of that month, as he tells us in his ‘African Hunting,’ he met with
the first “Inyalas” he had ever seen, and succeeded in bagging a fine
male, and subsequently more of them in the same district. A tinted
lithographic plate in Baldwin’s volume, drawn by Wolf, contains an
excellent representation of a group of these Antelopes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span></p>

<p>In 1871 the late Sir Victor Brooke published in the ‘Proceedings’ of
the Zoological Society a figure of the head and horns of this Antelope,
taken from a specimen in his own Collection. This figure, by the kind
permission of that Society, we are now enabled to reproduce (fig. 105).</p>

  </div>

<p>The Hon. W. H. Drummond, another well-known sportsman, who was in South
Africa from 1867 to 1872, writes of the “Nyala” as perhaps the most
beautiful of all the Antelopes he had seen there. “Unfortunately,”
he says, “it does not exist except in low, fever-stricken districts,
and I have never seen it south of the Bombo Range, about 28° S. lat.,
where it frequents the densest thickets it can find, and is wary and
difficult to stalk.” Mr. Drummond also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span> in his volume on the ‘Large
Game of South and South-east Africa,’ has given a lithographic plate
with figures of both sexes of this animal.</p>

<p>When he wrote his ‘Hunter’s Wanderings,’ in 1881, Mr. Selous, our
leading authority on the game-mammals of South Africa, had never
seen a living example of this Antelope. But in September 1896 he
made a successful expedition to Amatonga-land in search of it, and
subsequently wrote an account of his adventures on this occasion in
‘The Field’ newspaper, from which, by his kind consent, we make the
following extracts.</p>

<p>Arriving at Lourenço Marques on September 21st, he was invited by a Mr.
Wissels, a Cape colonist of German extraction, to visit his station
near the junction of the Pongolo and Usutu Rivers, where Inyalas were
said to be plentiful, and arrived there after a long tramp of several
days through the swampy forests.</p>

<p>We will give Mr. Selous’s account of his hunt after Inyalas in this
district in his own words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There were now abundant signs that I was approaching the
haunts of the beautiful Antelope I had come so far to seek, as
<i>Inyala</i> horns and skins were very much in evidence round
Mr. Wissels’s store, and several of the latter had manifestly
been but recently killed.</p>

<p>“All these animals, I was assured, had been shot by the Amatonga
within a short distance of the store, in the dense jungles lying
in the angle between the Usutu and Pongolo Rivers, which I could
now see covering some low ridges at a distance of not more than
six or seven miles from where we stood. Had it not been for
the rain, I should have gone on the same afternoon; however, I
gathered a good deal of information, and arranged for a start
with fresh carriers as early as possible the following day&mdash;my
objective point being the kraal of an Amatonga head-man named
Gugawi, who, I was told, lived a few miles up the Usutu River,
on the very edge of the jungle where <i>Inyala</i> were said
to be plentiful. I noticed, however, that my informants were
not over confident about my being likely to shoot any of these
animals.</p>

<p>“That night we had a most tremendous thunderstorm, the rain
falling in torrents; and, as the place in which I was sleeping
was not water-tight, I had rather a bad time of it, and was very
glad when day broke.</p>

<p>“The thunderstorm had cleared the air, and Sunday, Sept. 27,
dawned bright and clear, with every prospect of its being a fine
day. I had all my things packed up pretty early, and with four
new women-carriers, and accompanied by two men who knew the
way to Gugawi’s kraal, managed to get off about an hour after
sunrise, and reached my destination before 10 o’clock. On our
way we crossed the Usutu River&mdash;here a clear, swift-flowing
stream, about 200 yards in breadth, running over a bed of sand.
We waded across it, and found the water quite shallow for the
most part, and never more than 3 feet deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span></p>

<p>“On reaching the kraal we were making for, I told Longman
to cook me some breakfast, and whilst he was frying me some
Reedbuck steaks, I had a talk with the head-man, Gugawi,
and told him the reason of my visit. He replied that the
‘unbala-intendi’ were numerous in the jungle just behind his
kraal, and promised to do his best to help me to secure the
specimens I wanted, though, like everyone else, he said the
animals were very cunning and difficult to get a sight of. As
soon as I had had my breakfast I asked Gugawi to give me a man
who was well acquainted with the habits of the <i>Inyala</i>,
as I wished to go into the bush after them without any loss of
time. He gave me one of his sons, and, accompanied by Longman
and one of the Kaffirs who had come from Mr. Wissels’ store,
we forthwith entered the jungle, which extended to within a
few yards of the kraal. From this we were not distant more
than 200 yards before we saw fresh <i>Inyala</i>-spoor plainly
imprinted in the wet ground. The rain at least had done us this
service, that it had washed out all old spoor and rendered any
fresh tracks quite conspicuous. We now commenced to creep very
cautiously through the thick thorny bush, making our way for
the most part through tunnels made by hippopotami during their
night excursions in search of food. We had usually to walk bent
nearly double, often having to creep on our hands and knees;
and, as the air was now very hot and steamy, we were soon bathed
in perspiration. Now and again we came to little open spaces in
the bush, and in one of these which we passed through soon after
leaving the kraal I saw a very handsome Crested Guinea-fowl,
which looked very much like the birds I have seen on the Central
Zambesi, to the east of the Victoria Falls.</p>

<p>“We had been creeping about the bush in the uncomfortable manner
I have described for about an hour, when we came suddenly upon a
little circular opening some fifty or sixty yards in diameter.
As we approached the edge of this open space, advancing very
cautiously in a stooping attitude down a hippopotamus-path,
my guide suddenly dropped to the ground. As he did so, I got
a clear view past him, and saw standing amongst the grass and
bush, just on the further side of the opening, what I knew was
an <i>Inyala</i> ewe, as I could distinctly see it was reddish
in colour. I could see no other animal near her, and, as I
required two specimens of <i>Inyala</i> ewes, the one for the
British and the other for the South-African Museum, I lost no
time about firing at the animal in question, which I saw drop
instantly to the shot. But even as she did so, there appeared in
her place, or very close to where she had stood, a great black
shaggy form, which, indistinctly as I could see it in the deep
shadow of the bush, I knew was an <i>Inyala</i> ram, the first
that my eyes had ever looked upon in the flesh. My rifle was
a single-barrelled one; and before I could fire the shot that
might make that rare and beautiful beast mine, I had to open
the breech of my rifle, take another cartridge from my belt,
slip it into the chamber, close the breech again, and then raise
the rifle to my shoulder and take aim. All this meant time and
noise. Would the <i>Inyala</i>, which stood like a statue by the
dead body of its mate, give me the few seconds I required to
take his own life too? I little thought he would; but he did;
and as I raised my rifle once more, and took a quick but careful
sight at his dark shoulder, I felt, as I pulled the trigger,
that he was mine.</p>

<p>“As the report of the rifle sounded, he plunged madly forward
and was instantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> lost to sight in the thick scrub. But I felt
sure he carried death with him, and so it proved, for we found
him lying dead not twenty yards from where he had stood when the
bullet struck him. The fatal missile had passed right through
his shoulders, and, having expanded on impact, had torn his
heart to pieces. I had the dead ewe brought to where the ram had
fallen, and laid them side by side; and then stood admiring them
for a long time before I could bring myself to skin them. To
thus secure a very fine pair of <i>Inyala</i> Antelopes&mdash;whose
excellently-mounted skins are now safe in the Mammalian Gallery
of the new Natural History Museum in Cromwell Road&mdash;on the very
first day I had hunted for them, and after a little more than an
hour’s search, was indeed a most glorious and exceptional piece
of good fortune; which, however, has been balanced by many and
many a day that I can remember of unrequited labour in search of
game.</p>

<p>“As soon as I had stripped the skins, with the leg-bones still
attached, from my two beautiful specimens, I had them carried,
together with the skulls, to Gugawi’s kraal on the edge of the
bush, and there spent the remainder of the day in preparing them
for mounting. Of the meat, which was all brought in, I sent a
couple of haunches over to Mr. Wissels, and then, after keeping
a small piece for myself, gave the remainder to Gugawi to divide
amongst his people as he thought fit.</p>

<p>“Next morning I was up and out in the bush just as day was
breaking, accompanied only by my guide of yesterday and Longman,
who, however, kept some distance behind, in order to allow
my guide and myself to approach our game as noiselessly as
possible. We had been creeping about in the dense jungle for
some three hours without having seen anything, although there
was a good deal of fresh spoor about, and twice we had heard
<i>Inyalas</i> dash away through the bush without getting a
sight of them, when suddenly my guide crouched to the ground,
at the same time pointing towards a large ant-heap growing
out of the dense scrub, and itself covered with undergrowth.
Following the direction of his arm, I made out a reddish patch
not fifteen yards away in the gloom of the bush; and taking it
for an <i>Inyala</i> ewe, I fired into it point blank, as I
required another specimen for mounting. At the shot the animal
fell, and, on creeping up to it, I found that it was a young
ram. It was something less in size than a full-grown female,
from which it did not differ in any way in coloration, and the
number and distribution of white stripes and spots. It was
thus interesting, as showing that the <i>Inyala</i> changes
in general colour from red to grey, only losing the rufous
and orange tints on the ears and forehead, which were still
conspicuous in the type-specimen described by Mr. Angas, when
fully adult.</p>

<p>“On returning to the kraal, Gugawi proposed to take me to a spot
some few miles higher up the Usutu, where he said there were
plenty of <i>Inyalas</i>, whilst at the same time the bush was
not so dense as near his kraal. Being by this time thoroughly
sick of crawling about bent nearly double, I hailed with delight
the idea of finding the game I was seeking in a country where I
could walk upright, and visions of <i>Inyala</i> feeding through
open glades passed through my mind; visions, alas! which were
never realized, for in my small experience I never found these
Antelope anywhere except in dense bush. However, I was glad of
the change, and soon had everything ready for a move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span></p>

<p>“In the afternoon we travelled some five or six miles up the
river, and pitched camp in a bit of jungle near the water’s
edge. The Usutu River is here very broad, and reminded me
strongly of parts of the Chobi; but whereas the banks of the
latter river, as I knew it in the early seventies, abounded in
game of many descriptions, from the elephant downwards, there
was not a track to be seen along the Usutu of any kind of animal
with the exception of the <i>Inyala</i>. All the wealth of wild
life which Baldwin saw in this same district forty years ago
has melted away before the guns of the native Amatonga hunters;
for, be it noted, this is a country in which but very little
game has been killed by white men. Rhinoceroses, buffaloes,
koodoos, waterbucks, impalas, lions, all are gone&mdash;the only game
left being the <i>Inyalas</i>, which owe their preservation to
the dense jungles in which they live; and even they are being
rapidly killed off, as the natives are always after them, lying
in wait for them in the paths made by the hippopotami, or
creeping stealthily through the bush in their pursuit.</p>

<p>“It would be but tedious reading were I to continue to describe
in detail my further bush-crawling experiences in search of
<i>Inyalas</i>. Suffice it to say that on Oct. 1 and 2 I
secured two more good rams, and preserved their heads for my
own Collection. Although I should have liked to get a fourth
ram for the South-African Museum, I did not think it prudent to
remain any longer in my camp on the edge of a swamp, where I
knew the air must be reeking with malarial poison, as, besides
the exhalations from the marsh, the ground (from which I was
only separated at nights by a little dry grass and a blanket)
had been soaked to the depth of 2 feet by the recent rain,
thus rendering the conditions more than usually unhealthy. The
weather, too, was now again looking very threatening, and I did
not relish the idea of any further lying out in the rain; as I
knew, from former experience, that I should probably have to
pay for the wettings I had already suffered by some attacks of
fever&mdash;a disease from which I had been entirely exempt for seven
years, but the poison of which I knew was still in my blood, and
would be likely to be again stirred into activity by my recent
exposure to unhealthy conditions.</p>

<p>“Hence, on Saturday, Oct. 3, I packed up my things and returned
to Gugawi’s kraal, walking on in the afternoon to Mr. Wissels’s
store, and thence to Lourenço Marques, Delagoa Bay, which I
reached on October 7th, after a hot and weary tramp.”</p>
</div>

<p>Until lately the Inyala was believed to be restricted to the
coast-lands of Eastern Africa south of the Zambesi. Recently, however,
it has been discovered that this Antelope is likewise found further
northward on the Upper Shiré, where it is known to the natives as the
“Bō,” the <i>o</i> being pronounced very long. Mr. Alfred Sharpe,
C.B., on his return to England at the end of 1891, first brought home
a single flat skin of the so-called “Bō,” which was identified by
Sclater as belonging to the male of this species, and other specimens
have since been obtained in the same district. Mr. Sharpe’s information
was that it is found only in a piece of thick scrubby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> country
bordering the Moanza River, which enters the Shiré on its right bank,
near the Murchison Cataracts.</p>

<p>In 1895 a fine specimen of this Antelope was forwarded to the British
Museum by Mr. Gerald Oliver, R.N., of H.M.S. ‘Herald,’ with the
following information in an accompanying letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On the 5th of October, last year, I was shooting near a village
called Mantana’s (lat. 16° 30´ S., long. 35° E.), about 7´
W. by S. of Chilomo, near the right bank of the Shiré River.
Impala (<i>Æpyceros melampus</i>) are very plentiful about this
particular spot, but I had not been able to get a shot at a good
head. Later in the day, wanting meat, I decided to kill what I
could, and coming across a solitary doe I fired. Great was the
astonishment of myself and boys to find I had killed a female
Inyala. I took the skin to Chilomo, and was told it was the
first Inyala ever known to have been killed about these parts,
and that it was practically an unknown animal there.</p>

<p>“On the 26th of October, near the same spot, a male Inyala was
killed by the then Surgeon of this ship. On the 29th of October
I saw together 2 Inyalas and 8 Impalas. On the following day, at
dusk, I met with and killed a solitary male Inyala, whose skin
I forward. The natives were tremendously excited, dancing about
and exclaiming ‘Bōōh,’ ‘Bōōh,’ the local name for the Inyala.
They examined the body with great care. I was told in the
village that the natives, on account of some superstition, would
not touch the meat. Our bluejackets, however, ate it, and it was
very good. The skin was <i>remarkably</i> glossy and soft, and
the hair was long under the neck.”</p>
</div>

<p>In 1893 (see P. Z. S. 1893, p. 729) Sclater found a skull of this
Antelope in one of Mr. Crawshay’s collections from the district of Lake
Mweru, but we are not quite certain that it was actually obtained in
that locality. Sir Harry Johnston, in his volume on ‘British Central
Africa,’ sums up his information on this species as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am inclined to think that the Inyala Antelope of British
Central Africa is limited in its range, so far as we yet know,
to the Western and Upper Shiré districts and the Lake Mweru
district, and that it may be of a different form from the Inyala
of South-east Africa, inasmuch as the males retain the white
spots and stripes on the skin to a greater extent, and do not
assume such a grey fur at maturity. The Inyala, locally called
Bōō, is a very rare animal, frequenting dense thickets.
Its horns somewhat resemble those of the Bushbuck, but are much
larger proportionately, much wider apart, and slenderer. They
may measure as much as 22½ inches in length along the curve
(I have a pair of horns giving this measurement). I have only
twice seen skins of the adult animal. They were extraordinarily
beautiful in colour, the females a deep chestnut, with narrow
stripes and spots in pure white, and a black line along the
middle of the back from the neck to the base of the tail; the
male purplish-grey, with white markings.”</p>
</div>

     <p class="p0 center sm">Angas’ Antelope, ♂ &amp; ♀.</p>
  </div>

<p>There is also some reason for suspecting that the Inyala, or a nearly
allied form, extends even as far north as British East Africa. This
suspicion rests upon the evidence supplied by a pair of horns, not
specifically distinguishable from those of the typical <i>Tragelaphus
angasi</i>, which were procured from the Mau Forest by Mr. F. J.
Jackson, C.B. These horns, which are now in the British Museum, were
exhibited by Sclater before the Zoological Society of London in May
1897, and are figured on p. 455 of the Society’s ‘Proceedings’ for that
year (see fig. 107, p. 147). Unfortunately no skin accompanied the
horns; and the specific determination of the Antelope that bore them is
rendered uncertain on account of the description of the animal given
by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span> native hunter who killed it. This description, if accurate,
certainly applies to a species of Bushbuck distinct both from the
Inyala and from all the other known species of <i>Tragelaphus</i>.
Hence it is earnestly to be hoped that Mr. Jackson will soon be
successful in his attempt to clear up the mystery in which the identity
of this interesting Antelope is involved.</p>

  </div>

<p>We are not aware that any specimen of Angas’ Antelope has ever been
brought to Europe alive, and it is by no means commonly met with in our
museums. The British Museum contains an adult pair mounted, obtained
in St. Lucia Bay by Mr. R. S. Fellowes in 1871, also specimens from
the Pongolo River, Zululand, obtained by Mr. Eastwood, and from the
Maputa River, obtained by Proudfoot. There are also in the National
Collection the specimens from Nyasaland procured by Mr. Sharpe, Sir
Harry Johnston, Mr. Crawshay, and Lieut. Oliver, of which we have made
mention above. Finally, there is a good mounted pair of specimens
obtained by Mr. Selous during his special expedition in quest of this
Antelope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span></p>

<p>Our principal illustration of Angas’ Antelope (Plate XCII.) was put
upon the stone by Mr. Smit, under the directions of the late Sir Victor
Brooke, from sketches made by Wolf, and was probably taken from the
mounted specimens then in the British Museum. At the same time the
woodcut (fig. 106, p. 146), also containing figures of both sexes, was
prepared by Mr. Smit.</p>

<p>Medium or large-sized Antelopes allied to <i>Tragelaphus</i>, but with
rougher and shaggier coats, longer legs, and with horns which more
nearly approach those of <i>Strepsiceros</i>, as they show a strong
tendency to assume a third twist. Further, <i>Limnotragus</i> differs
strikingly from <i>Tragelaphus</i> and <i>Strepsiceros</i> in the
structure of its feet, the hoofs being often nearly three times as long
(measured along the front edge) as thick (measured along the margin of
the pastern). Moreover, the skin which covers the back of the pastern
is denuded of hair, and thick and horny, being practically of the same
consistency as the upper rim of the posterior side of the hoof.</p>

<p>It is not without some hesitation that we refer to a separate
genus those species of Tragelaphine Antelopes (hitherto placed in
<i>Tragelaphus</i>) which have undergone certain special modifications
of structure in adaptation to a semi-aquatic mode of life. In the
species of <i>Tragelaphus</i> discussed in the preceding part of this
work, as well as in all the other genera of Tragelaphinæ, the feet
adhere to the digitigrade type characteristic of most of the ruminant
artiodactyle Ungulates, retaining the short narrow hoofs and strong
elastic ankles fitted for easy and swift progress over the firm soil
of the veldt or woodland. In the species of <i>Limnotragus</i>,
on the contrary, the feet are furnished with hoofs of relatively
enormous length, which spread far apart at every step, and are
obviously designed to enable their owner to pass over the soft soil
of marshes and river-banks without sinking deeply into the ground.
This modification is accompanied by an increase in the flexibility of
the ankle-joints, which are capable of yielding to the weight of the
body, so as to allow the false-hoofs and the smooth tough horny skin
at the back of the pasterns to rest upon the soil, and thus to further
augment the supporting area of the foot. It is these peculiarities
in the structure of the feet, in conjunction with a length of limb
exceeding that of other Tragelaphines, which impart to the species of
<i>Limnotragus</i> that characteristic semiplantigrade aspect and that
unusual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span> awkwardness of gait so noticeable in these Antelopes when
walking upon firm resisting ground.</p>

<p>Up to the present time three species referable to this genus have been
described, namely, <i>L. spekii</i> from E. Africa, <i>L. gratus</i>
from Tropical West Africa, and <i>L. selousi</i> from the valley of the
Zambesi. Unfortunately there are not at present available materials
from the different parts of the area over which the genus ranges,
sufficient to enable us to determine satisfactorily the exact value to
be assigned to these three forms. Consequently, although the evidence,
so far as it goes, tends to show that the characters upon which they
have been based may ultimately prove to have merely a subspecific
importance, we prefer, for the time being, to allow them to take
the rank that was originally assigned to them by their respective
describers, and to arrange them as three species.</p>

<p><i>Adult male.</i> Height at the withers about 36 inches. General
colour a tolerably uniform greyish brown, greyer on the sides of
the neck; a dark median dorsal line running down the nape, over the
withers, and then passing into white in the middle line of the back.
Head with white ocular and cheek-spots and white chin, as in the other

an indistinct line of similar spots extending along the sides above the
belly, and in the adult at last only very ill-defined white stripes on
the body. Legs of a richer and darker brown than the body; fore legs
pale behind the knee and down the inner side of the cannon-bone, the
pastern-spots scarcely distinct; hind legs coloured like fore legs, but
pale in front of the hock.</p>

<p>Horns without a third twist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span></p>

<p><i>Subadult male</i> of a darker brown than the adult and with the

<p><i>Adult female.</i> Smaller than the male and of a rich dark red
colour, blacker dorsally, with a dark spinal stripe and very faint
indications of white stripes on the body. Fore legs blackish from

distinct.</p>

<p><i>Young female</i> more or less distinctly marked with white stripes

<p>[We have taken our descriptions of this species from a series of skins,
unfortunately for the most part imperfect and without determination of
sex, that were brought from Lake Victoria by Herr Oscar Neumann, who
has kindly lent them to us. Three of these skins appear to be those
of males, while the remainder, four in number, are, judging by their
colour, females, or young of doubtful sex. One of the latter has the
hoofs very much worn, and must be regarded from this circumstance
as adult, although it is very much smaller than the skin of what we
suppose to be the adult male.]</p>

<p>The name of John Hanning Speke will ever go down to posterity as
that of one of the most enterprising and most successful of African
Explorers. Speke, however, was by no means only an Explorer, he
was also an ardent lover of Natural History, and during his many
expeditions in Africa never failed to bring home such specimens as his
rapid mode of travelling would allow him to carry with him. Amongst
the discoveries of his celebrated journey of 1859–63 to the Victoria
Nyanza was the present Antelope, which he met with in December 1861,
when enjoying the hospitality of King Rumanika of Karagweh. The king
presented Speke with a living example of a young male of this species,
which had been captured in the high rushes at the head of one of the
neighbouring Lakes, and also gave him the horns of an adult male
specimen. We learn further, from Speke’s ‘Journal,’ that King Rumanika
was clad in a wrapper made of the skin of this Antelope, which is said
to be much prized by the natives for its excellent quality. For the
illustration of his ‘Journal of Discovery,’ published in 1863, Speke
had a beautiful woodcut prepared by Wolf from these specimens, which,
by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span> the kindness of Messrs. William Blackwood and Sons, we are enabled
to reproduce on the present occasion (fig. 108).</p>

<p>Sclater’s original description of this species, published in his report
on the Mammal-collection made during Speke’s journey, was based on
Speke’s specimens, and contained, besides a coloured illustration of
the younger animal by Wolf, a drawing of the horns and feet of the
adult, which, by the kind favour of the Zoological Society of London,
we are allowed to use again here (see fig. 109, p. 154).</p>

<p>Since the days of Speke the Sitatunga of this district has rarely been
met with by travellers, as, in addition to its being exceedingly wary
and timid, the impenetrable nature of the papyrus-swamps, which are its
habitual resort, precludes easy access to its retreats. It is, however,
occasionally trapped or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span> speared by the native fishermen, and pairs
of the horns thus obtained have occasionally reached Europe. The only
recent traveller, so far as we know, that has personally encountered
the ‘Nzoe’ in its native wilds is Mr. Ernest Gedge, who has kindly
favoured us with the following notes on this subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>“So far as is known at present, Speke’s Antelope is not to be
found anywhere in East Africa between the Victoria Nyanza and
the coast&mdash;in fact, the only occasion on which I had the good
fortune to encounter it was during my sojourn in the Budda<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
district of Uganda along with Capt. R. H. Williams, in the early
part of 1893, under the following circumstances:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We were told by the natives that these Antelopes (called by
them ‘<i>Chobé</i>’ or ‘<i>Njobé</i>’) existed in great numbers
on one of the small outlying islands which constitute the Sesse
group in the Victoria Lake. Being anxious to prove the truth of
this report, we embarked, and proceeded thither in canoes. The
island in question, which is situated well out in the Lake at a
distance of some 10 miles from the main island, was reached on
the afternoon of the second day. The shores are low and rocky,
and, with the exception of a small turf-covered portion at its
southern extremity, it is entirely covered with dense, almost
impenetrable bush, interspersed only by a number of fine trees,
principally species of <i>Ficus</i>. In shape it is something
like an irregular hour-glass, being possibly a third of a mile
in length and a few hundred yards across its greatest width. A
very short examination revealed the presence of the Antelopes,
and finding it impossible to approach them by any ordinary
methods of stalking, a drive was organized, with the aid of
the canoemen, with most satisfactory results: the total bag
amounted to 24 head, including some fine specimens both male and
female. This afforded ample testimony to their extraordinary
numbers, as, owing to the dense character of the bush, it was
impossible to see more than a few yards in any direction, and
many of them passed us unseen. The greater number were killed
in the first drive, after which the majority took refuge in the
Lake, which is said to be their habit when hard pressed, though
Speke describes them as being fierce and aggressive under such
circumstances. The specimens procured on this occasion have
been identified as true Sitatungas, though it is impossible to
imagine how they ever got on to the island, or came to frequent
a locality which is so entirely at variance with their usual
habits.</p>

<p>“These Antelopes are said to have also existed formerly on a
small neighbouring island, but to have been exterminated there
by the Ba-Sesse canoemen.”</p>
</div>

<p>During his recent travels in Uganda, Herr Oscar Neumann also obtained
a series of skins of this Antelope, which, as already mentioned, he
has most kindly lent to us for examination. We are sorry not to have
received any exact particulars respecting the specimens, except that
they were procured from the natives in the districts of Kavirondo,
Usoga, and Uganda, on the shores of Lake Victoria. Herr Neumann has
also sent us two pairs of horns of this species, which were obtained
from the “Wakenji” in the swamps west of Mount Elgon. Along with these
specimens we have received for comparison from the authorities of the
Berlin Museum a flat skin obtained by Herr Stuhlmann near the slopes of
Mt. Ruwenzori.</p>

<p>The National Museum of this country is, we regret to say, very
imperfectly furnished with specimens of the East-African form of the
Sitatunga, containing only the original examples of Speke. It will be
evident, therefore, that Herr Neumann’s kind assistance in this matter
has been of considerable value to us.</p>

<p>Our coloured illustration of this Antelope (Plate XCIII.) was prepared
by Wolf, under Sir Victor Brooke’s instructions, from Speke’s original
specimens. It will be noticed that the artist has joined the horns of
the adult animal to a body which must have been copied from the young
male, and has coloured the female from conjecture, representing it as
greyish brown instead of yellowish red. The accompanying woodcut (fig.
110) was likewise prepared by Mr. Wolf under Brooke’s directions.</p>

<p>In his original diagnosis of <i>Limnotragus selousi</i>, Mr. Rothschild
took the characters of the female from the specimen of this sex, from
Lake Ngami, now living in the Zoological Society’s Gardens. In the
specimens of <i>L. selousi</i>, however, from the Barotze River the
immature female is of a rich red colour, inclining to black in the
dorsal region, whereas the female from Lake Ngami was at the time
of its arrival in England, when only half-grown, of the same nearly
uniform tint as it is now when fully adult. Moreover, Mr. Selous, who
has seen many skins of this Antelope from the Chobé, kindly informs us,
in reply to an inquiry on this point, that the young are, according to
his experience, never rufous in colour; although when newly born they
are marked with white stripes and spots which subsequently disappear.</p>

<p>We cannot explain these discrepancies at present, but must leave the
matter as it stands for the investigation of future observers.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Swamps of the district of Lake Ngami and similar
localities on the Zambesi and its tributaries; thence north to
Lake Mweru.</p>
</div>

<p>The discovery of the existence of an Antelope of this water-loving
group in South-west Africa was made even before Speke obtained his
specimens of the last species in Karagweh. The well-known traveller,
Charles John Andersson, met with the “Nakong,” as he calls it, during
his explorations of Lake Ngami. In the volume descriptive of his
four years’ wanderings, published in 1856, when calling attention
to the great variety of large animals found in that district, more
especially in the vicinity of the rivers, he mentions “two new species
of Antelope, the <i>Nakong</i> and the <i>Leché</i>,” and gives a
lithographic plate, drawn by Wolf, to illustrate them as they appeared
in their native haunts. Not having before him actual specimens of
the former Antelope to draw from, the great artist had apparently
only Andersson’s somewhat imperfect information upon which to prepare
his likeness of the “Nakong.” He consequently gave a more prominent
place in his illustration to the Leché (<i>Cobus lechee</i>), and
hid the Nakong in a reed-bed, leaving only its kudu-like horns, of
which Mr. Andersson’s friend, Col. Steele, was fortunately able to
supply specimens, plainly visible. Andersson speaks of the Nakong
as a “Waterbuck,” which, by means of its peculiarly long hoofs, not
unfrequently attaining a length of six or seven inches, is able to
traverse with great facility the reedy bogs and quagmires with which
the country abounds.</p>

<p>Another well-known African explorer, Thomas Baines, who penetrated
far into South-west Africa from Walfisch Bay a few years later, also
mentions the <i>Nakong</i> as amongst several new or little-known
Antelopes found in that district.</p>

<p>About the same time also the South African Museum received specimens of
this Antelope from the Lake Ngami district, through Mr. J. J. Wilson,
of Otjimbinque, and Messrs. Chapman. Mr. Layard, in his Catalogue of
the Mammals of that Museum, published in 1861, refers these specimens
very doubtfully to <i>Tragelaphus eurycerus</i>, but shows very clearly
by his description that they really belonged to the present species.</p>

<p>Sir John Kirk, in his article on the Mammals of Zambesia, read before
the Zoological Society in 1864, mentions the “Nakong” as frequenting
the papyrus and rushes on the River Chobé. He naturally refers it to
<i>Tragelaphus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span> spekii</i>, with which, until quite recently, it was
generally believed to be identical. In the same way Sir Victor Brooke,
in his article on Speke’s Antelope and its allied species, published
in the Zoological Society’s ‘Proceedings’ for 1871, comprises in
his list of specimens of <i>Tragelaphus spekii</i> those of the two
allied forms, which we here treat of as probably distinct. Of these,
his specimens “<i>h</i>” (“frontal bones, horns, and feet, in the
collection of Mr. Oswell”) are, no doubt, referable to <i>Limnotragus
selousi</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Selous, in his excellent and often-quoted article on the Antelopes
of Central South Africa (P. Z. S. 1881, p. 753), writes of this species
(which Mr. Rothschild has appropriately named after the famous hunter)
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This Antelope is only met with in the extensive swamps which
exist in some parts of the interior of Africa. In the reed-beds
of the Mababe, Tamalakan, and Machabe rivers it is to be found;
and in the vast marshes through which the Chobe runs it must
exist in considerable numbers, although, as it only emerges
from the dense reed-beds at night, it is scarcely ever to be
seen. In 1879 I tried hard to shoot some of these animals on
the Chobe, searching for them in a canoe amongst the reed-beds
at early dawn and after sunset; but though I disturbed several,
and heard them splashing away amongst the reeds and papyrus, I
only saw one female alive, though one morning I found a fine ram
lying dead that had evidently been killed fighting with a rival
during the night. The head and feet of this animal I preserved.
The female that I saw was standing breast deep in the water, in
the midst of a bed of reeds, feeding on the young shoots that
just appeared above the water. When she saw us she at once made
off, making a tremendous splashing as she plunged through the
water. The natives told me that very often when these Antelopes
are met with under similar circumstances they do not attempt
to run, but, sinking down in the water, submerge their whole
bodies, leaving only their nostrils above the surface, and
trusting that their enemies will pass them unobserved; they (the
Kafirs) then paddle close alongside and assegai them from the
canoe. As all the Situtungas the skins of which I saw had been
killed with assegais, and not shot, I have no doubt that this
statement is correct. Another way the natives have of killing
them is by setting fire to the reeds when they become quite dry,
and then waiting for the Situtungas in their canoes in one of
the channels of open water by which the marsh is intersected.
Driven forwards by the advancing fire, the Antelopes are at last
obliged to swim across the open water to gain the shelter of
the reeds on the further side; and the natives are thus often
enabled to cut off and assegai some of them in mid stream.”</p>
</div>

<p>We have already alluded to the occurrence of this species in
Barotze-land, where Mr. Coryndon obtained specimens for Mr. Rothschild.
Still further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span> to the north-east we find that a species of the
Sitatunga group, which, we suppose, should also be referred to <i>L.
selousi</i>, occurs, according to Sir Harry Johnston, “in the swamps
of Lake Mweru, in the Loangwa valley, and in other parts of British
Central Africa.” Mr. Richard Crawshay, C.M.Z.S., has favoured us with
the following field-notes which he has drawn up as the result of his
long experience with the animal-life of the district of Lake Mweru:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This Antelope is known by the people of the Itawa and
Kabwiri&mdash;who are, as I have before mentioned, branches of the
Awemba&mdash;as ‘Mula.’ By the people of Ulungu and Mambwe (where I
suppose it is also found) it is known as ‘Nsowi.’</p>

<p>“I had been six months or more at Mweru before any proof was
forthcoming that such an animal existed. Then, when shooting
wild-fowl on the outskirts of a vast and impenetrable swamp
between Rhodesia and the Luao River, I came upon the remains of
what had been a fine pair of horns just on the margin of the
water. The horns had been submerged during the rains and were
fast decaying. All that was recoverable was one fairly sound
horn with a fragment of the frontal bone attached. This horn, I
think, measured 21¾ inches.</p>

<p>“Some months later when at Mkula’s, on the Chisela River, I was
given by the chief a perfect, though smaller, pair of horns.
A skin was also offered me&mdash;I don’t know if it was <i>the</i>
skin&mdash;but so discoloured with dirt and smoke, from lying in a
native hut, that I did not think it worth having.</p>

<p>“Mkula told me there were a good many ‘Mula’ in the swamps below
his town, and that one way or another his people had killed
seven or eight during the six years or so he had been at the
Chisela River, but that they were very difficult to get at, and
when got at&mdash;viz., roused&mdash;even more difficult to kill.</p>

<p>“On expressing my eagerness to shoot, or at least see, a ‘Mula,’
he did not give me much hope of doing either the one or the
other. A glance at the Chisela River reed-beds from a heap
outside the town did not reassure me. All the same, during
two visits to Mkula’s&mdash;one the middle of July, the other at
the very end of October 1892&mdash;I did my utmost to effect my
object, spending the greater part of my time in the swamp,
wading and wallowing in mud, water, and reeds, but found it
killing work. Scarcely a native would follow me in a second
attempt. The combined rays of the sun, mosquitos, leeches, and
a most sickening stench from the swamp, proved a severe trial
to my patience and perseverance. Ultimately I gave up without
getting a shot at a ‘Mula.’ Luckily such hard labour earned some
reward. I saw two ‘Mula’ and heard others, besides gaining an
insight into their ways and haunts. Were I to try again for this
Antelope under similar conditions, I would build a platform, 20
feet high or so, in the swamp, overlooking the feeding-grounds
of the ‘Mula,’ and would watch from this platform say from 3.30
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> until dark. The remains of the ‘Mula’s’ head from
the Luao River swamp, as also the horns given me by Mkula, were
sent home along with the other Antelopes’ heads.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span></p>

<p>So far as we know, only two examples of this Sitatunga have ever
reached Europe alive. Both of these are now living, in good health,
in the Zoological Society’s Gardens in the Regent’s Park. The first
arrival was a young female, received as a present from Mr. James A.
Nicolls, F.Z.S., of Belmont House, Navan, Ireland, on October 14th,
1890. In a footnote to Nicolls and Eglington’s ‘Sportsman in South
Africa’ we are informed that the animal in question was captured by Mr.
Nicolls alongside the dead body of its dam, which had been shot by him
in the Taoke swamp, forty miles from Lake Ngami.</p>

<p>On referring to Mr. Nicolls’s articles in the ‘Field’ newspaper, in
which his “Travels and Sport along the Botletle River and round Lake
Ngami” are narrated, we find the occurrence in question described as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At midday (in August 1887) we arrived at Ku-Ku’s. A native
missionary, who has spent several years in this country
representing the London Missionary Society, informed us that
his efforts towards converting the Western Bamangwato tribes
and Makobas to Christianity had up to the present proved
unsuccessful. From him we also received intelligence that
the Nakon waterbuck was very plentiful in the Taoke swamp, a
distance of twenty miles off. This was indeed very joyful news
to me, as I had always been most anxious to shoot a specimen of
this animal, a prize which, I understood, had not previously
been obtained by any white man, at least south of the Zambesi.
However, Ku-Ku strongly advised me not to go shooting in the
swamp till I had seen Moremi and obtained his permission to do
so, on account, Ku-Ku said, of that chief being very unwilling
to allow any strangers there, the district being used by his
people as a place of refuge in case of another attack by
the Matabele. I adopted his advice, which, as it turned out
afterwards, was rightly given.</p>

<p>“I arrived at De Nokane, Moremi’s town (a distance of 537 miles
680 yards from Khama’s). The station occupied by the chief is
situated on a small river which issues from the Okavango, and
finally gets lost in the vast Taoke swamp.</p>

<p>“At midday I came to a large Makoba village, built on a small
piece of rising ground adjoining the swamp. To the left,
right, and front, as far as the eye could reach, there was
nothing visible but vast patches of tall reeds; here and there,
on portions of more rising ground, little groves of dwarf
fan-palms; and occasionally, as if a godsend to relieve the
monotony of such a dreary landscape, a towering palm waved its
feathered head to the uncertain breeze.</p>

<p>“As I had still a long distance to walk before arriving at
the spot most frequented by the Nakon, and as I desired to be
there at least an hour before sundown (this, or shortly after
daylight in the morning, being the only time at which a fair
chance of a shot could be obtained), without making any delay,
I at once entered the swamp, and for the first half-hour waded
knee-deep in water, caused by a late overflow from the Taoke
river, and my progress, although very tiring, was at least
endurable. Resting for about twenty minutes on a small dry
knoll, overgrown with fan-palms, my Makoba guides, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span> whom I
had three, pointed to a long green streak of rushes about three
miles off, which, they assured me, was very much frequented
by the game I was in search of. Progression now became more
difficult, as the water not only became much deeper, but firm
footing was more uncertain, owing to the burrowing of fish in
the alluvial soil. One of my guides now took the lead, and with
the end of his long fish assegai tried every inch of the ground
in front as we went along. Notwithstanding his solicitude on
my behalf, I had the misfortune to plunge head forward into a
hole, thoroughly saturating my clothing and filling my rifle
with water. It was nearly four o’clock in the afternoon when
I arrived at another small island within 300 or 400 yards of
the fringe of reeds I have before alluded to, and which was
really the bed of the Taoke choked up by rotten vegetation and
papyrus-roots, the river slowly percolating through the mass.
Having enjoyed an hour’s rest on this haven of safety, and the
favourable time having arrived, I again proceeded onwards, and
found that my work up to that time had been merely child’s
play, compared to that which I now had before me. There was no
footing whatever obtainable, with the exception of a network of
papyrus-roots, which stretched along in every direction, and was
just sufficiently tough to support a man, the bog moving up and
down at every footstep. To add to the charm of the situation,
the mosquitoes, prematurely disturbed from their afternoon
siesta, rose in clouds from the rotten swamp, biting my face,
neck, and hands most viciously. Groping and staggering along
in this manner till about an hour before sundown, I had seen
no game, and was just beginning to give it up as a bad job,
when one of the Makobas pointed out the figure of an animal
lying, or standing, with a portion of its back and the whole
head out of the water, about 200 yards away. It was a Nakon
ram, carrying a very fine pair of horns; but from the position
he was placed in, I saw there was no earthly chance of killing
him at the distance. Thinking to approach a little, I advanced
cautiously; but had scarcely proceeded a dozen yards when, as if
out of the water, not more than 60 yards off, up jumped another
one, bounding along crossways with a most convulsive-looking
movement. I took a very hasty shot, and had the satisfaction of
seeing the animal tumble over with a big splash in the water. It
turned out, unfortunately, to be a doe, full-grown, with a young
one at foot. I had shot my first Nakon, and I solemnly affirm
it will certainly be my last, except under much more favourable
circumstances. An attempt to bring out the carcase that night
being utterly useless, two Makobas slept on the small island,
and I myself turned back to the village, where I arrived long
after midnight, and, although completely done up with fatigue,
could not sleep a wink, owing to the myriads of mosquitoes which
preyed on me the whole night long.”</p>
</div>

<p>From Lake Ngami the little animal thus captured was carried by Mr.
Nicolls and his companions in their waggon 800 miles to Kimberley, and
thence brought by rail and steamer to London. On arrival at the Gardens
it was placed in a sheltered compartment of the Gazelles’ sheds, in
which the yard in front was covered with dried peat-fibre in order
to suit its elongated hoofs. Accompanying the Secretary’s Report on
the additions to the Society’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> Menagerie in October 1890, in which
its arrival was noticed, will be found a coloured plate by Mr. Smit,
giving an accurate representation of the animal as it then appeared.
The Sitatunga thus acquired quickly attained its full stature, and
showing symptoms of readiness to breed, was placed, in 1894, in company
with a male of the Congo species (<i>L. gratus</i>) which had been
obtained by purchase from the Zoological Gardens, Hamburg, no male of
its own species being available. From this union hybrids were born on
February 12th, 1896, and on February 28th, 1897, being in each case
of the female sex. The period of gestation was, in both cases, about
seven months. The young animals in general appearance took after the
colour of the female of <i>L. gratus</i>, being of a generally bright
red colour with white lateral stripes and white spots on the haunches.
Such a young one is well represented, along with its mother, in the
background of our Plate XCIV. In June 1899 the Society were fortunate
enough to obtain a fine adult male example of this Antelope from the
Right Honourable Cecil J. Rhodes’s Park at Groot Schuur, near Capetown,
from which the principal figure in our Plate XCIV. has been taken. Mr.
Rhodes kindly accepted in exchange for it one of the female hybrids
above mentioned. The Society have therefore at present a unique pair
of this scarce and beautiful Antelope in the Collection, besides the
female hybrid born in 1896.</p>

<p>The specimens in the National Collection referable to this form
of the Sitatunga comprise two pairs of horns from the Chobé River
(<i>Selous</i>), one pair of young horns from Lake Ngami (<i>J. A.
Green</i>), the skin of an adult from the Zambesi (<i>Chapman</i>), and
a pair of horns from Lake Mweru (<i>Crawshay</i>).</p>

<p>When Mr. Rothschild separated this southern form of the Sitatunga as
<i>Tragelaphus selousi</i> in 1898 (Nov. Zool. vol. v. p. 206), he did
not distinctly state the specimen from which he took the description of
the adult male, but we presume it to be the above-mentioned specimen
from the Barotze District (<i>Coryndon</i>), which he has kindly lent
us. For the type of his female, however, Mr. Rothschild expressly
designates the female now living in the Zoological Society’s Gardens.
We are therefore, no doubt, correct in applying the appropriate
specific name “<i>selousi</i>” to the present form.</p>

to the nose from the inner corner of the eye on each side; two white
cheek-spots and sometimes a pale patch above the eye; chin and rim
of the upper lip white; two white patches on the throat, one at its
upper, the other at its lower end. Body with dorsal line white; a row
of white spots extending laterally above the belly, about six more or
less defined white stripes on the flanks and haunches, and some white
spots on the hind-quarters. Fore legs white on the inner side at the
base; the fetlocks and pasterns whitish in front: hind limbs white in
front of the knee and on the inner side of the cannon-bone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span> down to the

<p><i>Hab.</i> West Africa, from the Cameroons to the Congo.</p>
</div>

<p>The first allusion that we can find to the occurrence of a species of
the Sitatunga-group on the West Coast of Africa is in the Zoological
Society’s ‘Proceedings’ for 1848, where it is recorded that the
Secretary exhibited, at the meeting on June 13th, the skull and horns
of an Antelope closely allied to <i>Antilope euryceros</i>, Ogilby, and
read a letter in reference to it received from Capt. William Allen,
R.N. Capt. Allen described the appearance of the animal from memory
only, but stated that he had himself obtained the specimen at a place
called Kokki on the Cameroons River. The pair of horns in question
are now in the British Museum, and belong, in all probability, to the
present species.</p>

<p>In 1871 Sir Victor Brooke read an excellent paper on Speke’s Antelope
and its allies before the Zoological Society of London. The list of
specimens of his <i>Tragelaphus spekii</i> given in the ‘Proceedings’
contains examples of all three species of <i>Limnotragus</i>, as
we here consider them. The figure (fig. 112, p. 167) of specimen
“<i>g</i>” (which we are allowed to reproduce by the kindness of that
Society) was taken, we believe, from a West-Coast example, and is
therefore referable to <i>L. gratus</i>.</p>

<p>In 1880 Mr. Sclater received from Mr. R. W. Rolleston, of Liverpool, a
flat skin of the very remarkable red female of this species, said to
have been received from Gaboon. This was exhibited and described at
the meeting of the Zoological Society on June 15th of that year, and a
new species&mdash;<i>Tragelaphus gratus</i>&mdash;was founded upon it. Sclater’s
original description was accompanied by a beautiful figure of the
animal prepared by Joseph Wolf,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span> and put upon the stone by Smit. Soon
after this date Sclater was able to acquire some further information
concerning this interesting Antelope. On visiting the Menagerie of
the Jardin des Plantes at Paris in the autumn of the same year, his
attention was called to a pair of Antelopes lately received from the
Jardin d’Acclimatation, which he at once recognized as being the male
and female of his <i>Tragelaphus gratus</i>. On returning to England,
Sclater sent the typical skin of <i>Tragelaphus gratus</i> to Paris for
comparison, and convinced M. Milne-Edwards of its identity with the
living pair. Visiting the Jardin des Plantes again in 1881, Sclater
had the pleasure of inspecting for the second time this fine pair of
Antelopes, which were then accompanied by a young female, born in the
previous December. Mr. Keulemans, being at that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> time in Paris, was
employed to execute a water-colour drawing of these Antelopes, which
was subsequently published in the Zoological Society’s ‘Proceedings’
along with further notes on the same subject. M. Milne-Edwards informed
Mr. Sclater that the female of the pair had been received from the
Jardin d’Acclimatation in March 1876, and the male in November 1879,
and that both were believed to have come from Gaboon. The female had
brought forth her young one on December 4th, 1880, after a period of
gestation of 7 months and 24 days. A young male had likewise been born
of the same mother in December 1881, but had not lived long.</p>

<p>Besides those of Paris, several other Gardens in continental Europe
have of late years obtained specimens of <i>Limnotragus gratus</i>,
which, singularly enough, when we consider its habits in a state of
nature, appears to thrive in captivity and to breed with facility.
There are at present small herds of this species in the Zoological
Gardens of Hamburg and Amsterdam. Dr. Kerbert, the Director of the
last-named Garden, has kindly sent us for this work a list of the nine
individuals bred in that establishment from 1891 to 1896, which is here
subjoined:&mdash;</p>

<p>Dr. Kerbert observes that the colour of the young males and females
when born is exactly like that of the mother, but that the sexes are
easily distinguishable by the white hairs in the middle of the black
stripe over the back in the males.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span></p>

<p>The Zoological Society of London have not as yet been so successful in
the treatment of this Antelope. They received their first female in
1885, but lost it. A male purchased in 1894 bred with the female <i>L.
selousi</i>, as already mentioned, and produced two hybrids. A young
female bred at Amsterdam, and received in September 1898, was lost
shortly after its arrival.</p>

<p>In our illustration of this species (Plate XCV.) the male has been
drawn by Mr. Smit from the adult specimen above mentioned, now in the
Zoological Society’s Gardens. The female, in the background, was drawn
from the typical skin (now in the British Museum) upon which Sclater
founded the species in 1880.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span></p>

<p>The National Collection likewise contains a skin of an adult male (with
horns) of this Antelope, obtained by Mr. du Chaillu in Gaboon, and a
stuffed adult male from the same country obtained by purchase. From
this last specimen the drawing of the head (fig. 113, p. 169) was taken
by Mr. Smit in 1883. It has been kindly lent us for this work by the
Zoological Society of London.</p>

<p>Large-sized Antelopes resembling <i>Tragelaphus</i> and
<i>Limnotragus</i> in that the horns are spirally twisted and present
only in the male; but differing from these two genera in that the horns
are rounded behind at the base, with a scarcely appreciable external
ridge, and form from two and a half to three complete turns with a
more open spiral curvature. Further differing from <i>Limnotragus</i>,
but resembling <i>Tragelaphus</i>, in the structure of the feet,
which are adapted for progression on hard ground. Tail thickly hairy
at the sides as in <i>Limnotragus</i> and in most of the species of
<i>Tragelaphus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Adult male.</i> Height at withers about 50–52 inches. General colour
of body varying from reddish to pale slaty bluish grey, the latter
especially prevalent in older animals, and perhaps due, in part, to
the scantiness of the hair revealing the tint of the skin. Neck brown
on each side at its base and darker than the shoulders, becoming paler
towards its anterior extremity. Head darker fawn than the anterior end
of the neck, whitish around the eye, a white bar running inwards from
the corner of each eye and forming an incomplete <img src="images/bold_v.jpg" alt=""
style="height:.8em; vertical-align: middle;">-shaped
mark on the nose; two or three white cheek-spots; edge of the upper
lip and chin white, the white of the chin extending back on to the
fore part of the inter-ramal area. From the middle of this area back
to the hinder end of the throat extends a thickish mane of white and
blackish-brown hairs; no white patches on the throat. There is also a
dorsal mane passing from the occiput, backwards along the nape, over
the withers and down the spine to the root of the tail; the mane brown
on the neck and shoulders, white along the back. Sides of the body and
hind-quarters marked with white stripes, which vary in number from
about four in the northern forms to about nine or ten in the southern.
Tail white below, black at the tip. Belly greyish, blacker in the
middle. Fore legs of a rich fawn down the front, whitish at the base on
inner side and behind the knee, also on the inner and posterior side
of the cannon-bone, a pale blackish-brown patch above the knee on the
inner side; fetlocks and pasterns also rich fawn, black behind; the
white pastern-spots only just traceable. Hind leg coloured like the
fore leg; inner side of the thigh at the base and anterior side down to
the hock white, the white fading away between the hock and the pastern.</p>

<p>Horns with bold and open spiral curvature, measuring about 40 inches or
more in a straight line, and an additional 12 inches or so round the
curve; distance between the tips varying, irrespective of the length,
from about 24 to nearly 40 inches. The skull of an adult gives the
following measurements:&mdash;Basal length 15 inches, orbit to muzzle 9,
greatest width 6·33.</p>

<p><i>Female.</i> Generally similar to the male, but hornless and smaller
and slighter; similarly marked with white, but the ground-colour of the
body of a tolerably uniform fawn, becoming darker above.</p>

<p><i>Young</i> redder in colour than the adult and strongly marked with
white.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Hab.</i> Africa south of the Zambesi, extending on the west
into Angola, and on the east throughout East Africa up to
Abyssinia, mostly in the higher districts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span></p>

<p>We come now to one of the largest and finest of the whole long series
of African Antelopes. In Mr. John Millais’s well-known ‘Breath from the
Veldt,’ drawings of the heads of the Sable Antelope and the Kudu occupy
a conspicuous position on the cover. Mr. Millais, than whom there can
be no better judge, although he rather gives the palm to the Sable,
admits that the Kudu surpasses its rival “in elegance and general
appearance” when dead, but gives the Sable preference when seen alive
on the veldt. It is really a difficult question, he allows, to decide
between the “two rival beauties.” But we will proceed to the history of
the Kudu.</p>

<p>Although the Kudu was certainly known to Kolben and other visitors
to the Cape in early days, Buffon was the first writer to give us a
good account of it. In the twelfth volume of his ‘Histoire Naturelle,’
published in 1764, Buffon introduced it into his work under the title
of “Le Condoma,” and gave a figure of its unmistakable horns from
a pair in the possession of the Marquis de Marigny. In these horns
Buffon recognized the animal previously indicated by Kolben as a “kind
of large Wild Goat.” In the sixth volume of the Supplement to the
‘Histoire Naturelle,’ published in 1782, Buffon entered into fuller
particulars of the Kudu, which he now called the “Condoma ou Coësdoës,”
apparently recognizing that the first of these names had been based on
a mistake or misspelling. He was also now able to give a figure of the
whole animal from a well-preserved skin received from “the interior of
Africa.” Further information was added, taken from the Dutch edition
of the ‘Histoire Naturelle,’ which had been then recently published by
Schneider in Amsterdam, and to which Prof. Allamand had contributed a
description of this animal, based on a specimen living in 1776 in the
Menagerie of the Prince of Orange, to whom it had been sent by Joachim
van Plattenberg, then Dutch Governor of the Cape. In his first essay
on the genus <i>Antilope</i>, published in 1766, the great naturalist,
Pallas, placed the Kudu sixteenth in his list, basing it mainly
on the “Condoma” of Buffon, and proposed for it the specific name
“<i>strepsiceros</i>.” Although, therefore, the Kudu could not have
been the <i>Strepsiceros</i> of classical authors (which was in all
probability the Addax), there can be no question that the <i>Antilope
strepsiceros</i> of Pallas, as based on Buffon’s “Condoma,” is this
species.</p>

<p>In 1827, Hamilton Smith, writing on the Mammals in Griffith’s ‘Animal
Kingdom,’ used the term <i>Strepsiceros</i> as one of the subgeneric
divisions of his genus <i>Damalis</i>, thus, according to the views
of modern systematists,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span> creating a new generic name, which has ever
since been universally employed for the Kudu. Although many authorities
are of opinion that the adoption of a specific name for the genus
ought not to interfere with its usage for the species also, and
consequently that the present animal ought to be called <i>Strepsiceros
strepsiceros</i>, such has not been our custom in the present work, and
it is consequently necessary to search out the second given specific
name. For this there may be said to be two generally recognized
claimants&mdash;first, “<i>capensis</i>,” bestowed upon it by Dr. Andrew
Smith in 1834; and, secondly, “<i>kudu</i>,” applied to it by Gray in
1843. Of these we are inclined to adopt the former as first given,
although the latter has been more generally accepted.</p>

<p>It is true no doubt that so long ago as 1816, in his ‘Lehrbuch der
Zoologie,’ Oken introduced the Kudu into his list of the species of
the genus “<i>Cemas</i>” under the heading “<i>C. kuhdu, Strepsiceros,
Cervus capensis</i>.” But it does not seem to be quite certain that
Oken hereby intended to bestow on the Kudu a new specific name, and
under these circumstances it would be objectionable, we think, to call
the Kudu, <i>Strepsiceros kuhdu</i> (Oken). It has therefore been
decided to employ Andrew Smith’s name, concerning which there can
be no doubt whatever, for the present Antelope, and to designate it
<i>Strepsiceros capensis</i>.</p>

<p>The well-known travellers Sparrman (1785), Thunberg (1795), Daniell
(1804), Burchell (1822), and Steedman (1835), all met with the Kudu
during their journeyings in different parts of the Cape Colony, in
the more remote parts of which it was still plentiful in their days.
Harris (1836–37) states that although at that period the Kudu was
still found in many of the more retired portions of the Colony, he did
not himself meet with it until he had entered the “prolific environs”
of the Cashaan Mountains of Pretoria. Harris claims for the Kudu the
“right and title to the sovereignty of <i>all</i> the Antelopes.”
Other species of this group, he allows, may be “stately, elegant, or
curious,” but the Kudu is “absolutely regal.”</p>

<p>Harris, in the letterpress to his ‘Portraits,’ describes the habits of
the Kudu in the Cashaan Mountains in the following lively manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There in the depths of solitary woods, by human foot untrod,
the noble animal occurs in such every-day abundance, that many
a gory trophy was realized; but his great sagacity, wildness,
and self-possession, demanding the most skilful generalship to
out-manæuvre him, the pursuit necessarily differs altogether
from the usual stamp of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> African hunting, and involves no
inconsiderable acquaintance with the subtleties of woodcraft. We
have here no dashing among countless herds, no helter-skelter
riding by the side of a closely-packed phalanx; yet have we a
quarry well worth the hardest day’s fag on foot to triumph over.
Shunning both the open plain and the society of the multitude,
the crafty fellow never ventures from his almost inaccessible
fastness, unless during the morning and evening; and even then
must he be sought <i>au pied</i> amid the dark upland dells
which usually form his solitary abode. With all his wits about
him, the lordly bull, active and powerful, may now and then be
detected browsing at grey dawn upon some rugged hill summit, or
ranging some grassy slope, either alone, or escorted by a small
troop of skittish dames, all seeming alike his sentinels; but
taking the note of alarm from the slightest noise, he stamps
his brave foot upon the ground, tosses his spiral frontlet to
the blue sky, and once fairly in motion, never stops to look
behind until he has gained the threshold of his sanctuary.
There, in some deep chasm which the sunbeam rarely penetrates,
among tangled ravines, and hollows densely clothed with trees
and brushwood, he lazily reclines during the solar heat, beside
some fern-clad stone, and leisurely turns the cud until the cool
breezes of eventide once more invite him from his snug retreat.”</p>
</div>

<p>Amongst modern authorities on the Great Game-mammals of South Africa,
we may select passages from the writings of Mr. Kirby and Mr. J.
Millais as giving us good ideas of the present localities of the Kudu
and its usual habits. In his already-mentioned ‘Breath from the Veldt,’
Mr. Millais writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Though the species is gone from the countries south of the
Transvaal, there is still a very fair number in the northern
forests of that country, and these are not confined to ‘a few
troops which still linger,’ as most books on the subject would
give us to understand. The fact is, very little hunting goes
on in these countries, owing to absence of water and thickness
of the bush; the amount of game still to be found there cannot
therefore be very much less than in the greater part of
Mashonaland, which is very much hunted. I think the following
speaks for itself. Four hunters whom I trekked up with each
killed on an average ten Koodoos in three months, besides a lot
of Pallah and Blue Wildebeests; and this too, in every instance,
close to the main road in the Transvaal. If then they could do
this, there must surely be a very fair quantity of game in the
hundreds of untrodden miles in the south-west and east of the
several drifts of the Limpopo. In Mashonaland the Koodoo is
probably only reduced in numbers near the transport roads, while
it is still plentiful in the neighbourhood of all the rivers and
pans of that country where the bush is suitable to its habits.”</p>
</div>

<p>In his well-known volume on the ‘Haunts of Wild Game,’ Mr. F. V. Kirby
introduces us to the habits of the present species in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Koodoo frequent rocky bush-covered hills&mdash;the rougher and more
apparently inaccessible they are the better they like them;
but in the Low Country they are equally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span> at home in the heavy
belts of bush which line the rivers and water-courses. As a
rule, in the latter district they are fairly easy to run into on
horseback, although individual bulls and the cows will display
great speed and endurance; but in the hill country it requires
much patience and care to circumvent an old bull successfully.
Unfortunately for themselves, Koodoo are of a most curious
disposition, and seldom run far without standing and looking
back at their pursuer. Their leaping powers are marvellous, and
I have seen them clear obstacles 8 feet in height with apparent
ease. Their sense of hearing is very acute&mdash;one needs only to
look at the large, rounded, mobile ears to be satisfied on that
point; and I believe they trust more to that sense for their
safety than to any other. Though almost invariably found in the
near neighbourhood of water, I fancy they can go for a long time
without drinking, judging by the extensive dry areas in which I
have found them.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. W. L. Sclater, in his new volume on the Mammals of South Africa,
states that within the limits of his work (that is Africa south of the
Zambesi and Cunene Rivers) the Kudu is still probably the most abundant
and widespread of the larger Antelopes. Within the Cape Colony, Mr.
Sclater tells us, the Kudu is yet to be met with in the southern
districts, from the Riversdale and Prince Albert divisions, eastwards
to Albany and Fort Beaufort. It is stated to be even abundant in the
bush-country along the Koonap and Great Fish Rivers. In the northern
parts of the Colony it is also fairly common in parts of Griqualand
West and Prieska. In German South-west Africa, Bechuanaland, Rhodesia,
the northern and eastern parts of the Transvaal, the Portuguese
territories, and in Zululand it is also fairly plentiful in suitable
localities. In the South-African Museum at Capetown there are mounted
specimens of a male Kudu from near Barberton in the Transvaal, and of a
female from Koonap in the Albany division of the Cape Colony.</p>

<p>But the Kudu, as we shall see, ranges far beyond the limits of
Mr. Sclater’s South Africa, and we will now proceed to trace its
distribution throughout Eastern Africa into the northern territories of
Abyssinia and the Egyptian Soudan.</p>

<p>In Nyasaland, Mr. Crawshay tells us, the Kudu is to be met with
practically all over the Protectorate, especially in the rugged wooded
highlands away from the haunts of men. In the Portuguese provinces on
the coast, according to Peters, it appears to be likewise generally
distributed. Proceeding to German East Africa, we find it also widely
diffused there, extending westwards up to Lake Tanganyika, although, as
Herr Matschie tells us, it is “nowhere common.” In British East Africa,
Mr. F. J. Jackson informs us, the Kudu is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span> “a rare beast and only found
in certain places.” There are always “a few,” he says, “in the Teita
country west of Ndara and Kisigao, and on the banks of the Tsavo River,
down which it ranges from the head-waters to the Sabaki, and then north
up the Athi. All these districts are more or less undulating, very
rough, dry and stony, and covered with thick bush.” Further north, Graf
Teleki shot two Greater Kudus a few miles to the south of Lake Barengo,
and Dr. Donaldson Smith, in the course of his travels, saw one at El
Madu in about 4° N. lat. Mr. Arthur H. Neumann met with the Greater
Koodoo near Lake Rudolf, as related in his ‘Elephant-hunting,’ but
considers it very uncommon in the districts which he traversed. Passing
northwards to Somaliland, we find the Kudu more abundant on the higher
grounds. Capt. Swayne informs us that it inhabits the top of Wagar
Mountain and the Golis Range, which rise to about 6800 feet.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. H. D. Olivier, R.E., F.Z.S., who has recently returned from
a hunting excursion in Northern Somaliland, has favoured us with the
following notes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I first came across the Greater Koodoo in the Golis Range, and
I also found it to the west of Hargeisa and near Milmil, as far
south as lat. 8°. The first locality, however, was the only one
where I pursued it, and it was there more abundant than in the
two last-mentioned places. The Golis Range consists of a series
of high bluffs under which lies a sort of undercliff forming a
lower plateau. This is grown over with gigantic Euphorbias and
dense brushwood, interspersed with huge boulders which have
fallen from the cliffs above. The Koodoo apparently lie up in
very thick patches of such jungle, at least I always found
this the case, and the first intimation of their presence was
invariably a crash as the quarry dashed off, generally out of
sight. Their habit, however, of stopping after a hundred yards
or so, to examine the cause of their alarm, is often fatal
to them. They seem to lie pretty close, and on one occasion
I walked all round one without discovering it, which we did
eventually by finding its tracks at the end of our circuit and
following them up. The Koodoo browse on the young shoots, and I
have also found them eating the smaller kinds of Euphorbias.</p>

<p>“At the time I was looking for them the rainy season was on, and
I think this much assisted us, for it rendered tracking easy
and our movements less noisy than they would have been in the
dry weather. During five days’ shooting we saw five good bucks,
and secured three of them. I found that when alarmed they did
not travel very far, and that by patiently following the tracks
we generally came up to them within a couple of miles. All the
bucks I came across were solitary, and the hinds seemed to live
in small herds of from three to seven or eight. A sportsman
could not wish for a grander sight than a startled Koodoo
dashing off along the hillside, or standing on the look-out on
some point of vantage. Their flesh is poor eating, and their
hides are of little value from an ornamental point of view,
but the head and neck, and the ruff, when well mounted, form a
splendid trophy.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span></p>

<p>The existence of the Kudu in Abyssinia has long been recorded, and it
would appear to be found all over the wilder and more wooded parts of
that country from 3000 to 9000 feet in altitude. According to Rüppell,
however, who in 1835 first identified it with the Cape animal, the Kudu
descends nearly to the sea-coast near Massoua. Heuglin has likewise
recorded its presence in the Egyptian territories of the Atbara,
Galabat, and Bogos north of Abyssinia, as well as in Kordofan and
in the more elevated districts of the White Nile. Thus we see that
throughout the eastern part of Africa the Greater Kudu is one of the
most widely distributed of the larger Antelopes.</p>

<p>On the West Coast of Africa the range of the Kudu is much more limited.
It occurs, no doubt, in German South-west Africa, and has been recorded
by Anchieta from Angola, but we are disposed to consider its alleged
existence in the Congo Valley as not yet proven. Nor are we aware of
any evidence of its occurrence further north on the West Coast.</p>

<p>It is singular that, while its near relatives the Eland and the
Bushbucks thrive in captivity, the Kudu never appears to accommodate
itself well to existence in European menageries. During his long
experience Sclater has had opportunities of seeing many Kudus in
various Zoological Gardens, but does not recollect a single case in
which such an animal appeared to be in perfect health and condition and
likely to do well. The first Kudu received by the Zoological Society
of London arrived in 1860 along with other animals from the Cape,
presented by the late Sir George Grey. It was a female and did not
live long. In June 1868 a young male, from Upper Nubia, was acquired
by purchase, but was also quickly lost. Nor have the Society been much
more successful with specimens acquired in 1873, 1874, 1880, and 1895,
although a female purchased in 1873 lived nearly seven years in their
Gardens.</p>

<p>The accompanying woodcut (fig. 114, p. 183) was prepared by Mr. Smit
from the pair of Kudus which were living together in the Society’s
Gardens from 1874 to 1879.</p>

<p>Wolf’s beautiful drawing of this Antelope (Plate XCVI.) was prepared
some twenty-five years ago for Sir Victor Brooke, and exhibited at
the Zoological Society’s Meeting in June 1875, in order to show the
differences between this species and the Lesser Kudu, but we regret to
say we have been unable to ascertain upon what materials it was based.</p>

<p>In the Gallery of the British Museum of Natural History at South
Kensington there is to be seen a very fine and large mounted male
specimen of the Greater Kudu, which was shot by Mr. F. C. Selous on
the Macloutsi River, Upper Limpopo, in May 1890, and presented by that
gentleman to the National Collection. This splendid animal stands 59
inches in height at the withers and its horns are 43 inches long in
a straight line. There are also other specimens of the Kudu (skins,
skulls, or horns) in the British Museum from Bogos-land, Abyssinia, the
Shiré Highlands of British Central Africa, and the Cape Colony.</p>

eyes; ears whitish at the base and round the rim in front. Throat with
a conspicuous white patch at its base and fore extremity. A narrow
black stripe running along the nape of the neck from the occiput to
the withers; a white stripe passing along back from the withers to
the root of the tail. Sides of the body and hind-quarters marked with
from 11–14, sometimes confluent, white stripes, the first of these
crossing the shoulder, the last very short and close to the root of the
tail. Tail white beneath, black at the tip. Fore leg grey at the base,
the rest of the limb a rich fawn-colour from above the knee to the
hoofs, with a large white patch on the inner side at the base, white
behind the knee, a black patch just above the knee on the inner side;
cannon-bone blackish behind; pasterns black behind, marked with two,
sometimes confluent, white spots in front. Hind leg on the inner side
and front of the thighs down to the hock white, from the hock downwards
bright fawn; front of the pastern and inner side of the fetlock white.
A scanty but longish mane on the nape of the neck and withers, and a
short but thick crest of hair running along the back. Hair on the sides
of the neck and the throat very short, shorter than on the shoulders.</p>

<p>Horns of the male less divergent and with the spiral curvature much
closer and less open than in <i>S. capensis</i>, the ridge forming a
nearly straight axial line; length in a straight line about two feet,
round the curve about two feet six inches. The skull of an adult male
gives the following measurements:&mdash;Basal length 11·75 inches, orbit to
muzzle 6·75, greatest width 4·20.</p>

<p><i>Female.</i> Like the male, but without horns, and smaller and
slighter in build; without a mane on the neck; white marks on the head
and throat less pronounced; head more uniformly fawn, and body of a
rich reddish fawn only tinged with grey; neck duller than the body.</p>

<p><i>Young male.</i> Like the female, but assuming the grey coat of the
adult before it reaches its full size.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Somaliland and the maritime district of British East
Africa.</p>
</div>

<p>The late Edward Blyth, well known for many years as the zealous
Curator of the Museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, was the first
to point out that the Kudu had a smaller brother, which, though
nearly allied, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span> specifically quite distinct from its better-known
relative. Although it is probable that Blyth was wrong in some of the
identifications of previous writers which he assigned to the present
species, he was undoubtedly correct in his general views on the
subject, and had the merit of assigning to the new <i>Strepsiceros</i>
the appropriate name <i>imberbis</i>, which at once distinguishes it
from its neck-maned ally.</p>

<p>It is singular that while the Greater Kudu, as we have just shown, has
such a widely-extended range in Africa, the Lesser Kudu is restricted
to a comparatively very small area, extending only, so far as is
certainly known, from Somaliland in the north to the coast-region of
British Central Africa in the south.</p>

<p>After Blyth the Smaller Kudu appears to have next attracted the
attention of Sir John Kirk. Writing to Sclater from Zanzibar, where
he was British Consul, in 1873, Sir John stated that he had obtained
from the Brava coast a living female Kudu which appeared to belong to
a smaller species than the ordinary form (<i>cf.</i> P. Z. S. 1873,
p. 195). Two years later, in June 1875, the late Sir Victor Brooke
exhibited at a meeting of the Zoological Society of London original
drawings by Wolf of the two Kudus, and pointed out the distinctions
between them (see P. Z. S. 1875, p. 470). These drawings are, as we
have every reason to believe, the originals from which the figures
(Plates XCVI. and XCVII. of the present work) were prepared by Smit.</p>

<p>In 1878 Sir John Kirk obtained from the Sultan of Zanzibar another
specimen of what he called the “Dwarf Kudu” from the southern part of
the Somali country, and sent it off to the Zoological Society (see P.
Z. S. 1878, p. 441). Unfortunately, however, the animal died on its way
home.</p>

<p>It was not, therefore, until 1884 that good specimens of the Lesser
Kudu were received in Europe, and a proper comparison could be made
between it and the larger and better-known species. This was done by
Sclater, and the results were stated in a communication made to the
Zoological Society on February 5th of that year. Sclater’s materials
were mainly a pair of animals which he had seen alive in the previous
October in the menagerie of his friend the late Mons. J. M. Cornély,
of Château Beaujardin, Tours. The young male of this pair, having
died, was kindly sent to London by M. Cornély and formed the subject
of a plate, drawn by Smit, which accompanies Sclater’s article on this
animal in the Zoological Society’s ‘Proceedings.’ On the occasion of
reading his paper, Sclater was likewise able to exhibit an adult head
of the Lesser Kudu which had been sent home by Sir John Kirk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span> and a
pair of horns of a rather younger male of the same animal, belonging to
Mons. Cornély, which had been received by him through Mr. Hagenbeck, of
Hamburg, from Somaliland, along with the living pair of animals just
mentioned.</p>

  </div>

<p>By the kind favour of the Zoological Society we are enabled to
reproduce here (fig. 115, p. 188) the comparative illustration of the
horns of two species of Kudu which accompanies Sclater’s paper on this
subject in the Society’s ‘Proceedings.’</p>

<p>Mr. E. Lort Phillips, F.Z.S., appears to have been one of the first
English sportsmen who personally met with the Lesser Kudu in Somaliland
and realized its difference from the Greater Kudu. This was in the
winter of 1884–85, when Mr. Lort Phillips visited that country along
with Messrs. James, Aylmer, and Thrupp. In his notes on the Antelopes
obtained during this journey (see P. Z. S. 1885, p. 931), Mr. Lort
Phillips informs us that the Lesser Kudu was met with on the northern
slopes of the high plateau of Northern Somaliland, where it resorts to
thick covert, and that it was not usually found far from water. Since
that date most, if not all, of the numerous British shooting-parties in
Somaliland have succeeded in obtaining heads of this beautiful species.</p>

<p>Capt. Swayne, our leading authority on the Antelopes of Somaliland,
writes of the Lesser Kudu as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is, to my mind, quite the most beautiful of all the Somali
Antelopes, and the skin is more brilliantly marked and the body
more gracefully shaped than that of the Greater Koodoo.</p>

<p>“The Lesser Koodoo is found in thick jungles of the larger kind
of thorn-tree, especially where there is an undergrowth of the
<i>hig</i> or slender-pointed aloe, which is of a light green
colour and grows from four to six feet high. This Antelope
may also be found hiding in dense thickets of tamarisk in the
river-beds. It is not met with in the open grass plains, and
I have never seen one in the cedar-forests on the top of the
Gólis. Its favourite haunts used to be along the foot of this
range, and I do not think its numbers have been much diminished
of late years. By far the best Lesser-Koodoo ground I have ever
visited is the thick forest on the banks of the Webbe, near Imé
and Karanleh. These Webbe specimens are different from those
found under Gólis, as they are smaller, have shorter horns, are
still more brilliantly marked, and have hoofs nearly twice as
long. The hoofs of a Webbe Lesser Koodoo are, like those of a
Webbe Bushbuck, of extraordinary length.</p>

<p>“The Lesser Koodoo likes to be near water, and, living as it
does amongst the densest thickets, has its ears wonderfully
well developed. It has powerful hind-quarters, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span> a strong
leaper, the white bushy tail flashing over the aloe-clumps as
it takes them in great bounds. They are very cunning, and will
stand quite still on the farther side of a thicket listening to
the advancing trackers, then a slight rustle is heard as they
gallop away. The best way to get a specimen is to follow the
fresh tracks of a buck, the sportsman advancing in a direction
parallel with that of the tracker, but some fifty yards to one
flank and in advance; a snap-shot may then be got as the Koodoo
bounds out of the farther side of a thicket, but you may be
months in the country before getting a really good buck. They go
in herds of about the same number as do the Greater Koodoos. Old
bucks are nearly black and the horns become smooth by rubbing
against trees; and scars of all sorts remain on the neck, being
the result of wild rushes through the jungle and fights with
other bucks. The average length of a good buck’s horns is about
25 inches from base to tip. The longest I have shot or seen was
between 27 and 28 inches in length in a straight line. The horns
are very sharp, but I have never seen a Lesser Koodoo attempt to
charge.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lt.-Col. H. O. Olivier, R.E., who has lately made a short hunting-tour
in Somaliland, sends us the following field-notes on the Lesser Kudu:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Lesser Koodoo is, I consider, a more difficult animal to
circumvent than the Larger Koodoo. They are met with in thick
scrubby jungle and are extremely wary. I found that when once
they had seen us it was almost hopeless to get a shot, as they
have a habit of standing in deep shade looking back over a fork
of a tree or through the top of a bush along their back track,
and one cannot evade their eyesight, however quietly one moves.
Moreover, they constantly go off down-wind.</p>

<p>“They seem to be partial to moving in a restricted range, for I
found that when following their tracks they always worked round
in a circle. They are also very partial to disused zarebas,
which they visit for the sake of the grass found there, and
the finest animal I ever saw was observed sunning itself in
the middle of such a zareba about 9 o’clock in the morning.
Naturally I had not my rifle, and my shikari, who had it, did
not see the Koodoo, and though I followed it for some six hours
I never got a chance at it; but it was a real beauty.</p>

<p>“I was fortunate in twice getting shots at animals before
they saw me by coming unexpectedly on them and not tracking
them, which latter operation is a weariness to the flesh and
exasperating to the temper. I found the Lesser Koodoo at the
foot of the Golis Range, and in considerable numbers on the
Farfan and Dachato Rivers; also to the west of Hargeisa, and
indeed in the Hargeisa jungle itself. They seemed to go in very
small parties; I never saw more than two together, and at the
time I was in Somaliland, <i>i.e.</i> from May to August, the
tracks were always solitary.</p>

<p>“They appear often to fall victims to wild beasts, more often
than most Antelopes. I found one killed by a lioness, another
by a panther, and a third by wild dogs. Both the last were
bucks&mdash;in fact I came across many more males than females, but
this may have been chance.</p>

<p>“Their coat of slaty grey with irregular stripes harmonizes
wonderfully with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span> foliage, and, as in the case of the
Cheetah in India, exactly reproduces the chequered shade of
sunshine through leaves.”</p>
</div>

<p>We have already spoken of the occurrence of the Lesser Kudu on the
Brava Coast in Southern Somaliland, and this species is stated by Mr.
Hunter to be one of the commonest Antelopes on the Tana River. The
same writer informs us that it is also found in the bush round Taveta,
and on the Kikavo River near the Sogonoe Hills, but is seldom met with
near Kilimanjaro. As Mr. F. J. Jackson writes (‘Big Game Shooting,’
vol. i. p. 304), the Lesser Kudu is confined, in British East Africa,
principally to the belt of dry bush-country which extends from the
coast to 100 miles inland. Mr. Jackson continues his remarks with the
subjoined interesting notes on this species:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was told by Messrs. Hobley and Bird-Thompson, on their return
from a trip up the Tana river in 1891, that many of these
Antelopes had fallen victims to the cattle disease (anthrax),
and that they found several dead in the bush between the river
and the northern boundaries of the Elkambani. These beautiful
beasts are bush feeders. They should be sought for in the early
morning and again in the evening, in the open bush which usually
fringes thick bush, in which they take up their quarters for the
day. They are generally found in small parties of two or three
does and a buck, though, like the Bushbuck, both single bucks
and does are often seen by themselves. At Marereni, in 1886,
I witnessed a fight between two bucks. On emerging from the
bush, I suddenly came across them, and watched them for about
a quarter of an hour as they fought with great fury, in spite
of my being to windward of them, and not more than 400 yards
off at the time. They fought so furiously, and kept their heads
together so long, that I thought they had got their horns locked
together, and I attempted to take advantage of them whilst in
this position, and ran across the sandy open space intervening
between us, but before I got within range they separated and
bolted. The jumping powers of the Lesser Kudu are simply
marvellous. When I first went to Africa, I kept a record of the
length of the strides of the various game-beasts when at full
gallop, but unfortunately lost it, and never took the subject up
again. I remember, however, measuring the jump of one of these
beasts, which struck me at the time as being very wonderful. She
had been chased by a hyæna along a narrow footpath in a dense
bush. In the middle of a path was a thick green bush about 5 ft.
high, round which the path took a turn, and then went straight
on again. The Kudu had taken a flying leap over this bush, and
the distance between the spoor of her hind feet where she took
off and the edge of the bush was 15 ft. The diameter of the bush
was 6 ft., and the distance from the edge of the bush on the
further side to where she landed&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to the spoor-marks
of her hind feet&mdash;another 10 ft., in all 31 feet. The hyæna had
given up the chase some 30 yards further on, where the Kudu had
entered the bush. The note of alarm of this beast is a distinct
and loud bark, much resembling that of an ‘old man’ baboon.
Lesser Kudu appear to bark only when they scent danger but are
unable to see it. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span> I have said before, many natives will not
touch the flesh of this beast, as it causes them great pain in
the mouth and gums.”</p>
</div>

<p>We have already mentioned the fact that a living pair of the Lesser
Kudu was received at the Château Beaujardin, Tours, from Somaliland,
by Mons. Cornély in 1884. In April 1886 Mons. Cornély was kind enough,
having lost the female of a pair of these Antelopes then in his garden,
to part with the solitary male in favour of the Zoological Society
of London. This was the first specimen received in England; but in
April 1889 a second example, likewise a young male, was presented to
the Society’s Collection by Mr. George S. Mackenzie, F.Z.S. In July
1898 a third young male was obtained by purchase. But none of these
individuals, we regret to state, can be said to have done well in the
Regent’s Park. We are not aware of any specimen of this Antelope having
been received in any of the many continental Gardens.</p>

<p>In the British Museum, besides the old stuffed specimen received
from the East Indian Museum, which may be considered the real type
of Blyth’s species, there is mounted in one of the large glass-cases
in the Gallery the young male presented by Mons. Cornély to Sclater
and figured in the Zoological Society’s ‘Proceedings,’ as already
mentioned. This was subsequently presented by Sclater to the National
Collection. In the same glass-case there are also mounted a fine adult
male from Somaliland, presented by Mr. R. McD. Hawker, and a female
from British East Africa, presented by Mr. Rowland Ward. There are also
skins and skulls in the Museum presented by Sir John Kirk, Col. Paget,
Capt. Swayne, and other donors.</p>

<p>Our drawing of this beautiful Antelope (Plate XCVII.) was put upon the
stone by Mr. Smit from the sketch made for Sir Victor Brooke by Wolf in
1875, of which we have already spoken.</p>

<p>Very large, heavily-built, bovine Antelopes, differing from the rest of
the Tragelaphinæ in the presence of horns in both sexes. Horns longer
than the face, arising well behind the orbits and directed backwards in
the plane of the nasal bones, massive (in the male) and furnished with
a strong but close spiral twist in the basal half; the anterior crest
large, making a complete circuit of the horn and reappearing on its
anterior surface near the middle when the horn is unworn, and always at
some distance from the tip.</p>

<p>Hair on the forehead longer than on the rest of the head, and forming,
in old males, a thick and stiff mat; hair on the nape forming a short
mane reversed in the direction of the growth, the parting close to the
withers. Throat furnished with a flap of loose skin, or dewlap, which
bears a beardlike tuft of hairs.</p>

<p>Tail reaching to the hocks, covered with short hair, but tufted at the
tip.</p>

<p><i>Female.</i> Like the male, but slighter in build; without the thick
frontal mat of hair; horns longer, thinner, less strongly crested, and
usually much less twisted. Mammæ 4.</p>

<p>Adult male, at the withers, about five feet ten inches or, according
to some writers, sometimes considerably over six feet in height. Body,
head, legs, and neck of a tolerably uniform tawny colour, but often
assuming a slaty-grey hue in old age, owing to the rubbing off of the
hair and the consequent exposure of the skin beneath. Frontal mat of
hairs varying from yellowish brown to black, apparently becoming darker
with age; nose generally ashy black; lips and chin white. Ears narrow
and pointed, of a uniform greyish-fawn tint, with at most a small
black patch on the lower rim in front. A narrow black spinal stripe,
extending from the withers to the base of the tail. Tail-tuft and tuft
of hair on the dewlap black. Legs like the body, but, on the inner
side, sometimes with a greyish patch above the knee on the pasterns;
back of the pasterns and narrow rim above the hoofs and false hoofs
black.</p>

<p>Horns about 30 inches or more in length.</p>

<p><i>Female</i> like the male in colouring, but smaller and more slightly
built; the horns thinner, less strongly crested, and less twisted, but
usually longer and (exceptionally) reaching a length of 34 inches.</p>

<p>The subspecies <i>T. o. livingstonii</i> is generally similar to the
typical form,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span> but has the coat of a ruddier fawn-colour, and is
ornamented on each side of the body and hind-quarters with from about
eight to eleven narrow vertical white stripes: these are strong upon
the flanks and faint upon the haunches; they commence from the black
spinal stripe and gradually fade away upon the belly and lower part of
the thighs. In the typical form, moreover, there is a large black patch
on the inner and posterior side of the fore leg above the knee. Horns
reaching about 32 inches.</p>

<p><i>Female</i> differing from the male in the same respects as in <i>T.
o. typicus</i>.</p>

<p>The subspecies <i>T. o. gigas</i> is based on a pair of horns obtained
by Heuglin on the White Nile, and distinguished by their large size,
great length (35 inches), and strong corrugations. From Schweinfurth’s
observations we learn that this form carries well-marked body-stripes
throughout life, sometimes 15 in number. In these two respects it would
seem to approach <i>Taurotragus derbianus</i>, but Schweinfurth says
nothing about the black neck of the last species.</p>

now extinct) to Angola on the west and to the Transvaal and
Mozambique on the east, and thence up to the Zambesi; at
its northern limits passing into the striped form (<i>T. o.
livingstonii</i>), which extends throughout Eastern Africa up to
and rather beyond Mount Kenia; also found on the White Nile and
in the adjacent districts (<i>T. o. gigas</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>At the close of the long series of Antelopes we arrive at the largest
and finest form of the whole group, and one, moreover, that might well
become of great economical importance to mankind, if proper measures
were taken for its acclimatization.</p>

<p>The “Eland,” as it is now universally called, was well known to the
early settlers of the Cape, where it received its name from some
fancied resemblance to the Elk (<i>Alces machlis</i>), which is the
“Eland” of the Hollanders and the “Elenn” or “Elendthier” of the
Germans. It must have been size, we suppose, more than any other point
of similarity, that induced the Dutchmen to apply such an unsuitable
name to this animal.</p>

<p>The old traveller Peter Kolben, about 1719, gave the first
recognizable, though rather misleading, account of the Eland, which
at that epoch was still found in the mountains near Capetown. In 1764
Buffon, in the twelfth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span> volume of his ‘Histoire Naturelle,’ called it
“Le Coudous,” or, at any rate, gave unmistakable figures of its horns
under that name, which, we suppose, he had by some error transposed to
it from the Kudu (<i>Strepsiceros capensis</i>). It was mainly upon
Kolben’s <i>Alces capensis</i> and Buffon’s “<i>Coudous</i>” that
Pallas, in his first essay on the genus <i>Antilope</i> (1776), based
his <i>Antilope</i> <i>oryx</i>, alleging that it “seemed to be” the
<i>Antilope oryx</i> of ancient authors! At the same time he states
that he had examined a complete skeleton of this animal in the Museum
of Prince William of Holland. Very unfortunately, in his second and
amended list of the Antelopes, Pallas proposed to make a change in his
former names by transferring the term “<i>oryx</i>” to another animal
(the <i>Antilope bezoartica</i> of his first memoir) and assigning
the new name “<i>oreas</i>” to the Eland. This change, however, we
may say, has been generally acquiesced in, and the name <i>oreas</i>
has been almost universally applied to the Eland, either specifically
or generically, until modern days, when the zealous searchers after
priority have resuscitated Pallas’s long-forgotten term “<i>oryx</i>.”
This, indeed, seems certainly to be the earliest specific name
applicable to the present animal and should, in strict justice, be
adopted.</p>

<p>As regards its generic name the Eland has been equally unfortunate.
Desmarest, in 1822, first proposed to use “<i>Oreas</i>” as a
subgeneric term for this form; and Gray, in 1850, employed it as a
genus, combining it with the specific term “<i>canna</i>,” so that
the name of the Eland became <i>Oreas canna</i>. As will be seen by
our list of synonyms, this name was generally adopted, and has been
in constant use for the present species for the last twenty years. We
have, however, shown that “<i>oreas</i>,” as a specific term, must
give place to “<i>oryx</i>”; and in like manner “<i>Oreas</i>” cannot
stand as a generic term for the present animal, because it has been
previously employed in zoology as a genus of Lepidoptera (1806) and as
a genus of Mollusca (1808), both of which antedate Desmarest’s use of
it in 1822. Under these circumstances it is necessary to adopt the next
given name, <i>Taurotragus</i> of Wagner, and the correct scientific
name of the Eland, according to modern usage, will be <i>Taurotragus
oryx</i>.</p>

<p>Having now stated at full length our reasons for the unwelcome but
necessary change of name of this Antelope, we will resume our comments
on its literary history.</p>

<p>In the Supplement to his ‘Histoire Naturelle,’ published in 1782,
Buffon was able to give an improved account of the Eland. This was
mostly copied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> from Allamand’s article inserted in Schneider’s
edition of the ‘Histoire Naturelle,’ issued at Amsterdam in the
previous year, and was accompanied by a perfectly recognizable figure
of the whole animal under the name of “Le Canna,” adopted from its
supposed Hottentot appellation. Shortly afterwards (1783) Vosmaer,
in a number of his ‘Regnum Animale,’ published a full description
and coloured figure of the Eland from a specimen then living in the
Menagerie of the Prince of Orange in Holland, probably the same as
that from which Allamand had taken his information. Sparrman, who
visited the Cape about this period, also gave a good account of the
structure and habits of this Antelope, as observed by him in the
Alexandria and Somerset-East Divisions of the Colony. Paterson, in
1790, recorded having met with Elands in Caledon, as also in the
Van-Ryndorp and Uitenhage Divisions a few years previously. Thunberg,
another well-known traveller and naturalist (1795), found the Eland
in Uniondale, and Lichtenstein in Calvinia, Aberdeen, and Middelburg
(1803–4). Our countryman Burchell, as recorded in his ‘Travels,’ came
across Elands in 1822, in Prieska, Herbert, and Britstown, and found
them numerous in Hanover.</p>

<p>We may now pass on to the days of Harris, whose celebrated
hunting-expedition into the interior took place in 1836 and 1837. Even
at that date the Eland was pronounced to be extinct in the Cape Colony,
but was met with in abundance on the banks of the Vaal River, where
Harris feasted himself and his followers on its succulent meat.</p>

<p>By all classes in Africa, Harris writes, the flesh of the Eland is
deservedly esteemed over that of any other animal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Both in grain and color it resembles beef, but is far better
tasted and more delicate, possessing a pure game flavor, and
exhibiting the most tempting looking layers of fat and lean&mdash;the
surprising quantity of the former ingredient with which it is
interlarded exceeding that of any other game-quadruped with
which I am acquainted. The venison fairly melts in the mouth;
and as for the brisket, that is absolutely a cut for a monarch.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is right, however, to mention that other experienced authorities do
not altogether agree with Harris’s pronouncement on this subject. Mr.
Selous, for example, states his opinion that the flesh of the Eland has
been “very much over-estimated,” and is “not to be compared in flavour
with that of the Buffalo, Giraffe, Hippopotamus, and White Rhinoceros.”
(<i>De gustibus non est disputandum</i>!)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span></p>

<p>Harris describes the favourite haunts of the Eland on the Vaal River in
his days as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Eland frequents the open prairies and low rocky hills
interspersed with clumps of wood, but is never to be met with in
a continuously wooded country. Rejoicing especially in low belts
of shaded hillocks, and in the isolated groves of <i>Acacia
capensis</i> which, like islands in the ocean, are scattered
over many of the stony and gravelly plains of the interior,
large herds of them are also to be seen grazing like droves of
oxen on the more verdant meadows, through which some silver
rivulet winds in rainbow brightness betwixt fringes of sighing
bulrushes. Fat and lethargic groups may be seen scattered up and
down the gentle acclivities, some grazing on the hill side, and
others lazily basking in the morning sunbeam. Advancing they
appear to move like a regiment of cavalry in single files, the
goodliest bulls leading the van; whereas during a retreat these
it is that uniformly bring up the rear. As the day dawned over
the boundless meads of the Vaal River spread with a rich carpet
of luxuriant herbage, and enamelled with pastures of brilliant
flowers, vast droves of these lordly animals were constantly
to be seen moving in solemn procession across the profile of
the silent and treeless landscape, portions of which were often
covered with long coarse grass, which when dry and waving its
white hay-like stalks to the breeze, imparted to the plain the
delusive and alluring appearance of ripe cornfields.”</p>
</div>

<p>Since Harris issued his work in 1840 all the writers on the
game-animals of Southern Africa have devoted more or less space to
the Eland. Delagorgue, who published his travels in 1847, found
this Antelope in plenty in Zululand. Methuen, in his ‘Life in the
Wilderness’ (1848), describes its habits in the Kalahari Desert, and
Livingstone (1857) alludes to the Eland as being able to exist without
water, and states that one may see hundreds of them in places thirty or
forty miles distant from that element. The Hon. W. H. Drummond, in his
‘Rough Notes on the Large Game of South Africa,’ has devoted a whole
chapter to the pursuit of the Eland, which he met with on the Black
and White Umvalosi Rivers, and in other districts, but not within the
Colony itself, in which, according to Bryden, it became extinct between
1840 and 1850, having probably lingered longer in the waterless deserts
of Bushman’s Land than in any other locality.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. H. A. Bryden, writing in 1897, in his ‘Nature and Sport
in South Africa,’ on the rapidly disappearing forms of South-African
game, laments the noblest of all the Antelopes of the world as taking
the lead in this sad progress. At the present time, he says, one must
go far north into the parched and pathless recesses of the Upper
Kalahari before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> “vanishing Eland” can be reached, and “even in
these unexplored wilds these rare creatures can nowadays be scarcely
considered safe.” Mr. Bryden proceeds to describe the progress of its
extermination now going on as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Directly the rain falls, hunters from among the Bakwèna,
Bangwaketse, and Bamangwato tribes, well-mounted, and armed
with breech-loading rifles, penetrate to the innermost recesses
of the Kalahari, and, wandering from one pool of rain-water
to another, deal destruction among the game, and especially
among the Giraffes and Elands. That Elands are still plentiful
in these regions of the Kalahari I can personally testify,
having found them in numbers, and procured specimens in two or
three days’ hunting from the desert road between Khama’s and
the Botletli river (between Inkonanē and Kannē) within
recent years. Coming down country, too, I saw at Sechele’s
town&mdash;Molepolole&mdash;numbers of horns and heads of freshly slain
Elands, some of them magnificent examples, which had been
recently shot by Bakwèna hunters. But that, even in the North
Kalahari, these and other game can long resist the incessant
war of extermination waged against them, I am much more than
doubtful.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus we see that the typical brown unstriped Eland, which formerly
pervaded the whole of the Cape Colony and the adjacent districts, and
in 1652 (according to Van Riebeck) was found even on Table Mountain,
is now, as nearly as possible, extinct; although its closely-allied
white-striped brother, called Livingstone’s Eland, after the
distinguished explorer and missionary, is still to be met with in the
countries further north. As regards the points of difference between
Livingstone’s Eland and the typical form, which we will now proceed to
explain, we cannot do better than quote from Mr. Selous’s excellent
article on the subject lately published in Mr. Rowland Ward’s ‘Great
and Small Game of South Africa’:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Eland of South-western Africa, as described by the
earlier European travellers who visited the Cape Colony in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and more recently figured
by Sir Cornwallis Harris from specimens obtained in 1837 in
what is now British Bechuanaland and the Western Transvaal, was
of a uniform pale fawn-colour from birth, though the coats of
the older animals gradually became so thin that the dark colour
of the underlying skin showed more and more through the scanty
hair, giving them a general greyish appearance, the old bulls
often looking a bluish-black in deep shade, and being described
by the colonists as ‘blue bulls.’ On the other hand, all the
Elands found throughout Rhodesia and Eastern South Africa, and
wherever I have travelled to the north of the Zambesi, are
striped. The calves are a rich reddish-fawn in ground-colour,
with a dark mark down the back, black patches on the insides of
the fore-legs, and eight or nine conspicuous white stripes on
each side,”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span></p>

<p>As these striped Elands grow up, Mr. Selous continues, they differ
considerably one from another. Both bull and cow become of a bluish
grey as their coats become thinner with age, and at a little distance
the white stripes are often indistinguishable, although as long as
there is any hair left they can always be seen on close inspection.
Also the dark patches on the inner sides of the front legs become more
faint with age, and in very old animals disappear altogether.</p>

<p>Mr. Selous also points out that intermediate forms are found between
the two subspecies of Elands, and that, in fact, there is a complete
passage through a long series of variations from one form to the other.</p>

<p>That this is the case is shown clearly by Mr. Selous’s own
observations. He writes (in the same work) as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In April 1879 I shot some Elands in the Northern Kalahari,
between Bamangwato and the Botletli River. None of these Elands
showed any signs of stripes, but two of them had light grey
patches on the insides of the fore-legs. About 150 miles farther
north, however, nearly all the Elands that I shot were more or
less striped, though in most cases the stripes were so faint
that they only became apparent on a close inspection. Travelling
northwards towards the Chobi River, I found that although
Elands were still to be met with, on which no stripes could
be detected, most of them were more or less plainly striped,
the patches on the insides of the fore-legs becoming gradually
darker at the same time. North of the Chobi, and between that
river and the Zambesi, the Elands, taken as a whole, become
well striped, and the dark markings on the insides of the
fore-legs more and more conspicuous, many individuals being as
richly marked as the real <i>Taurotragus oryx livingstonii</i>,
which was first observed by Dr. Livingstone at Sesheke,
immediately north of the Central Zambesi. Thus, speaking from
my own experience, I should say that all the Elands found in
South Africa at the present day south of the 23rd parallel of
latitude are grey Elands (<i>Taurotragus oryx typicus</i>),
but that north of that parallel of latitude a tendency to show
white stripes on each side of the body, and dark patches on
the insides of the fore-legs, together with a dark median line
down the centre of the back, from the withers to the tail,
commences. I would say further that this tendency is at first
confined to certain individuals, but becomes more general, and
the white stripes and dark markings gradually more intensified
in individuals, as one travels north and north-east, until north
of the Zambesi and in Mashunaland, and all over South-eastern
Africa, all the Elands are striped without exception, and all
of them show black patches on the insides of the fore-legs
and a dark mark down the centre of the back, and often a
white arrow-shaped mark across the nose, as in the Koodoo and
Bushbuck.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Bryden and other well-known authorities on the game-animals of
South Africa entirely confirm Mr. Selous’s observations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span></p>

<p>Under these circumstances it seems quite impossible to treat
Livingstone’s Eland as a distinct species, but, as will be seen by our
list of synonyms, we have placed it under a different heading, and
have assigned most of the references to Elands north of the Zambesi to
<i>Taurotragus oryx livingstonii</i>.</p>

<p>We will now, starting from the Zambesi, endeavour to trace the Eland
into the most northern part of its range.</p>

  </div>

<p>Peters, in his ‘Reise nach Mossambique,’ gives several localities for
the Eland in the Portuguese Provinces on the Zambesi. Mr. R. Crawshay,
who has devoted great attention to the Antelopes of Nyasaland, tells
us that the Eland is widely distributed there, both on the hills and
on the wooded plains at the foot of them, and gives many localities in
which they are to be met with. As regards its markings, he informs us
that it is subject to great variety in British East Africa, “both in
colour and as regards the plainness or otherwise of the white stripes.”
In a single troop, individuals may be seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span> varying from a light tawny
yellow to the slaty blue of old age, while in some the stripes are
clearly defined, in others faintly, and in others again they are not
distinguishable at all.</p>

<p>In 1895 Sir Harry Johnston, K.C.B., F.Z.S., presented to the Zoological
Society of London a remarkably fine pair of horns of Livingstone’s
Eland, which are now suspended in their meeting-room at Hanover Square.
The animal which carried them was shot in 1893 in Nyasaland between
Zomba and Lake Chilwa. By the kind favour of that Society we are able
to insert in these pages a copy of the figure of these horns (fig. 116,
p. 205), which was published in the ‘Proceedings’ for 1895.</p>

<p>When we go further north into German East Africa, the Eland appears to
be not quite so abundant, although Herr Matschie mentions it as found
in Usagara, and it was seen by Neumann between the Pangani River and
Irangi during his recent journey, besides having been met with in Ugogo
by Speke and Grant in former years.</p>

<p>In British East Africa it would appear to be more prevalent again,
although somewhat local. Mr. Jackson, in his volume on ‘Big Game,’
writes as follows concerning its range and habits in that country:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The striped variety of the Eland is the only one found in
British East Africa. It is known to the Swahilis as ‘Mpofu,’ and
is decidedly a local beast. It is seen more often in open bush
and country thinly wooded with mimosa-trees than quite out in
the open. In 1887 it was plentiful round Taveta, where I have
seen as many as from sixty to seventy in one herd. In the open
bush country west of Mount Kisigao Elands are fairly numerous.
Other places in which they are found are the park-like country
below Ndi in Teita; the open country east of Ndara and north of
Mount Maungu; and the Siringeti plains. I have also seen them
between Lakes Nakuro and Baringo, and again in Turkwel, in the
Suk country. As a rule they go about in herds of from four or
five up to fifteen or twenty. Sometimes two or three bulls will
be found together, but very often an old bull is met with quite
by himself.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. S. L. Hinde has kindly favoured us with the following field-notes
of his recent experience of the Eland in British East Africa:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Having just returned from British East Africa, where I have
spent the greater part of the last five years, the following
field-notes may be of some interest to you. The Eland of East
Africa, which, so far as I have observed, has well-marked white
stripes on its back and haunches, is both rare and wary. It is
reported to have suffered severely from the rinderpest in the
early nineties. In the bush-country within 200 miles of the
coast, and more particularly in the neighbourhood of what is
known as the Taro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span> Desert, Elands have always been met with,
and are even now comparatively numerous. But the heads from
the herds in this neighbourhood, if one may judge by the few
specimens which have been obtained, have usually small and
misshaped horns. Outside the bush-country, on the Mkindu and
the Athi Plains, herds of the Eland are occasionally met with,
but there is no doubt that they migrate from one district to
another. It is commonly reported that Elands were never seen on
the Athi Plains until a few years ago, but at present, during
the months of June, July, and August, Elands are generally to be
found in the vicinity of the Athi river. In these months of the
years 1898 and 1899 there were, to my knowledge, two or three
herds of Elands on the Athi Plains. The largest herd that I
observed contained over 60 head, but I have never seen a really
good pair of horns from this neighbourhood.”</p>
</div>

<p>Count Teleki, as we are informed by Herr v. Höhnel in his narrative of
the first expedition to Lake Rudolf, met with the Eland on the Likipia
plateau, north of Mount Kenya, where, according to a letter addressed
by v. Höhnel to Sclater, they encountered a herd of about 170. But
we are not aware of any evidence of its being found further north in
British East Africa or in any part of Somaliland. Here, therefore,
we appear to have reached its furthest limits in this direction, but
further west, in the Valley of the Nile, there is good evidence of the
existence of this form of Antelope in much higher latitudes.</p>

<p>The famous explorer Baron von Heuglin was the first traveller who
recorded the existence of an Eland in the districts of the Upper Nile,
although v. Pruyssenaer (as Heuglin states) had previously recognized
its occurrence on the Bahr el-Abiad and Bahr-el-Sobat. But Heuglin,
having obtained a pair of Eland’s horns from the Upper White Nile,
about 7° N. lat., referred them, on account of their large size, to
a new species, “<i>Boselaphus gigas</i>.” He gives a figure of these
horns and states that they measure 35 inches in length, and show a
distance of 32 inches between the two points. We have thought it
advisable to reproduce Heuglin’s figure of this remarkable pair of
horns (see fig. 117, p. 208). In a subsequent work (‘Reise in das Geb.
d. Weiss. Nil’) Heuglin adds that his <i>Taurotragus gigas</i> is found
in pairs and singly in the forests of the Djur River and amongst the
Arol negros.</p>

     <p class="p0 center sm">(Heuglin, Ant. u. Büff. N.O.-Afr. pl. i. fig. 2.)</p>
  </div>

<p>The well-known traveller Schweinfurth, in his ’Im Herzen von Afrika,’
also alludes more than once to the existence of the Eland on the upper
confluents of the White Nile. In the first place, he met with it in
Bongoland, where he says that it resorts to the drier slopes of the
hills during the rains, and descends to the valleys in the winter
months. In the second volume of his narrative, Schweinfurth mentions
it again, and gives two figures of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span> horns of what he calls the
Central-African Eland, of two very different forms. Schweinfurth
states that the skin is plainly striped, and that this is certainly
no mark of youth, because he has seen very old examples which had
about fifteen narrow parallel stripes, about a finger in breadth, on
both sides. It is quite evident, therefore, that the Eland of this
part of Africa belongs to the striped form. It may be identical with
<i>T. o. livingstonii</i>, but, as Heuglin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span> has given it a name, we
will allow him the benefit of the doubt for the present, and will call
this northern striped form <i>Taurotragus oryx gigas</i> until further
investigations have been made.</p>

  </div>

<p>Before closing our systematic account of the Eland we must say a few
words respecting some curious horns which were at first ascribed to a
new and unknown Antelope, but are now generally admitted to be nothing
more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span> abnormal horns of the cow Eland. These horns were first
brought before the scientific world by Dr. Günther, who exhibited
a pair of them at a meeting of the Zoological Society in 1889, and
stated that they had been obtained on the frontiers of Natal. Dr.
Günther’s opinion was that they belonged to an unknown Antelope of the
Tragelaphine group, but under the uncertainty as to what form they
were most nearly allied, he proposed to designate the presumed species
<i>Antilope triangularis</i>. Through the courtesy of the Zoological
Society of London, and with Dr. Günther’s kind permission, we are able
to reproduce here the illustration of these horns (fig. 118, p. 209)
which accompanied Dr. Günther’s paper in the Society’s ‘Proceedings.’</p>

<p>Writing of these horns in 1891, Mr. Lydekker was so convinced of their
essential difference from those of any other known Antelope that he
proposed to raise the animal that bore them to generic rank under the
name “<i>Doratoceros</i>.”</p>

<p>Some years subsequently, in 1896, Sclater obtained, on loan, a fine
pair of horns of nearly similar character from Mr. Justice Hopley,
of Kimberley, and, after comparing them with the typical pair of
<i>Antilope triangularis</i> in the British Museum, came to the
conclusion that they must have belonged to the same species of
Antelope. Mr. Justice Hopley’s pair were not quite so long, rather more
incurved backwards, and less broadly spread; they were also smoother at
the base, showing but slight traces of corrugations. When exhibiting
these horns to the Zoological Society, Mr. Sclater stated that he
could see nothing whatever to negative the opinion, already prevailing
amongst other naturalists, that these horns were abnormal horns of
the cow Eland, which had grown into a lengthened form without making
the ordinary twist usually observable in that species and in other
Tragelaphs. It is right to add that Mr. Lydekker himself is now also of
the same opinion, and has stated (‘Horns and Hoofs,’ p. 260) that these
horns “are almost certainly abnormal specimens of those of a cow Eland.”</p>

<p>As we have already stated, living examples of the Eland were received
in Holland from the Cape as long ago as about 1783, when they were
described by Vosmaer and others as being in the menagerie of the
Prince of Orange. In England the first examples of this species of
which we can find any record were those which constituted the herd
in the celebrated menagerie of Edward, 13th Earl of Derby, President
of the Zoological Society of London. There is, unfortunately, little
information available as to the origin and history of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span> this celebrated
herd, but from some notes published by Lord Derby in the first volume
of the ‘Gleanings,’ we learn that the first specimens received were
obtained for him by Mr. Burke from the Cape in November 1842, and
consisted of two males and a female. The female first bred in August
1843, and produced young in 1844, 1845, and 1846, at which date Lord
Derby remarked that he had in his possession four males and two females
of this Antelope. At the dispersal of the Derby Menagerie by auction
in October 1851 the Knowsley herd consisted of two males and three
females. These passed into the Gardens of the Zoological Society of
London, having been selected out of the whole stock by the Council of
the Society in virtue of a bequest by Lord Derby to that Society of any
group of animals in his collection that they might prefer.</p>

<p>The original stock of the Zoological Society’s herd of Elands
consisted, therefore, of these five animals received by the Society
in December 1851. Of these an old female had been born at Knowsley in
1846, and the other individuals, two males and two females, had been
imported by Lord Derby in 1850. These animals throve well in their new
quarters and began to increase rapidly. As will be seen by the list
given in Wolf and Sclater’s ‘Zoological Sketches’ (vol. i.), two calves
were born in 1853, three in 1854, four in 1855, and four in 1856. The
first additions made to the original stock were a female presented by
the late Sir George Grey in April 1859, and a male received in exchange
from Viscount Hill in November of the same year. Since the date of its
first institution, the Zoological Society’s herd of Elands has never
failed, although occasionally reduced to somewhat small dimensions.
Nearly every year one or more Eland-calves have been born in the
Gardens, and care has been taken to lose no opportunity of introducing
fresh blood whenever the occasion has offered. At the present moment,
however, we regret to say, in consequence of the great difficulties
now prevailing in obtaining living examples of the larger Antelopes of
Africa, the Eland is represented in the Society’s Antelope-House by
only two specimens, namely, a male, about six years old, bred in the
Jardin d’Acclimatation of Paris, and received on October 12, 1898, and
a young female, purchased of Herr Reiche, of Alfeld, in April 1899. The
latter is more rufous in colouring and shows slight traces of stripes,
which, however, she may probably lose when quite adult.</p>

<p>From these two specimens our illustration of <i>Taurotragus oryx
typicus</i> (Plate XCVIII.) has been prepared by Mr. Smit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span></p>

<p>Besides the Zoological Society’s animals, the only herd of Elands that
we are aware of now existing in this country is that belonging to the
Duke of Bedford, the President of the Zoological Society of London,
which is kept in the beautiful Park at Woburn, along with a splendid
series of Deer and other Ungulates. Through the kindness of His Grace
we have been furnished with the following particulars concerning this
herd, which now consists of fourteen individuals. Three of these are
adult females, two of which were purchased from dealers, and the third
from the Zoological Society of London, in whose Gardens it was bred.
The adult male was purchased of Herr Reiche, of Alfeld. Five young
males and two females have been bred at Woburn up to the end of 1899.
Three calves, one male and two females, have been born at Woburn since
the commencement of the present year.</p>

<p>Allusion has already been made to the Elands possessed by the late
Roland, Viscount Hill, who, about the year 1861, possessed a fine
herd of these animals. When visited by Sclater about that date, Lord
Hill’s stock consisted of three males and seven females, which were
kept at his Lordship’s residence Hawkstone, in Shropshire. They were
the produce of individuals principally purchased by him from the
Zoological Society, and were kept in grazing paddocks in Hawkstone
Park. Unfortunately, a few years later Lord Hill lost his interest in
these animals and got rid of them.</p>

<p>About the same period John, 2nd Marquis of Breadalbane, likewise
purchased a herd of Elands, which, however, we believe, was not
maintained long after the Marquis’s death in 1862.</p>

<p>In almost all the Zoological Gardens of the Continent also the Eland
is a well-known object of interest, and in many of them, until the
last few years, has thriven well and produced its kind; but, as
already mentioned, the supply of Elands from abroad has recently much
decreased, and at the present time there is a great difficulty in
keeping our herds of Elands in Europe up to the mark by the necessary
introduction of fresh blood.</p>

<p>One of the chief ornaments of the Mammal-Gallery in the British Museum
is the mounted pair of Livingstone’s Elands obtained by Mr. F. C.
Selous in Mashonaland in 1883. The male (as Mr. Selous informs us) was
shot near Sadza’s Kraal, west of Marandalla’s, a station on the main
road from Salisbury to Umtali, in July of that year, and the female
near Salisbury in the following October. The male stands 67¾ inches
high at the withers, and carries a pair of horns 22½ inches in length
in a straight line; the female is 57½ inches in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span> height, and has horns
27 inches in length. In both these animals the lateral stripes are well
defined, and there are no black patches above the knee on the fore leg
of the male, though in the female the patches are slightly visible.
These specimens are fair representatives of <i>Taurotragus oryx
livingstonii</i>, and have been figured as such in our illustration
(Plate XCIX.), prepared by Smit. But it is right to add that it appears
that the skins have apparently shrunk slightly in drying, as in his
measurements of the male specimen in question, lately given in the
‘Great and Small Game of Africa’ (p. 426), Mr. Selous states that the
height of this animal, “taken on the naked carcase after the skin had
been removed,” was 69 inches. Moreover, in former days there were
probably still larger specimens, as such reliable authorities as Barrow
and Harris agree in stating that the old male Elands were known to
attain a height of 6½ feet at the withers.</p>

<p>There are also in the National Collection other skins and skulls of the
Eland obtained by Mr. Selous, and a number of other specimens, amongst
which we may specify a skull and horns of a female from Nyasaland,
presented by Sir Harry Johnston, and a skull and horns from the
district of Kilimanjaro, presented by Mr. F. J. Jackson in 1892. We may
remark that examples of the Eland of the White Nile (the problematical
<i>T. o. gigas</i>) are much wanted to complete the series in the
National Collection, besides which specimens from other definite
localities in Eastern Africa and Angola would be very acceptable.</p>

</div>


<p>Exact height at withers unknown, but probably equal to, if not
exceeding, that of the preceding species (70 inches). Forehead covered
with hair of a rich ruddy-brown hue, extending from the base of the
horns to a point below the level of the eyes; nose black; sides of the
head dusky brown or dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span> fawn; a whitish stripe running inwards and
forwards from the inner edge of the eye on each side; upper lip and
chin white. Ears large and expanded, much larger than in the other
species; the margins broadly white in front and ornamented on the lower
side with a large black patch; the posterior surface mostly black,
brownish at the base. Neck covered with long hair of a dark brown or
black colour, blacker towards the shoulder than in front; base of
the neck bordered by a white collar, directed obliquely upwards and
backwards at least halfway up to the withers. Body of a rich ruddy
fawn-colour, becoming paler or nearly white below, the middle of the
belly black; a broad black stripe of longer hairs extending all down
the spine from the neck to the root of the tail; sides of the body and
haunches ornamented with thirteen or fourteen narrow white stripes,
commencing at the dorsal stripe above and gradually fading away on the
lower part of the belly and hind-quarters. Legs down to the knees and
hocks of the same colour externally as the body, whitish on the inner
side; there is a large black patch on the fore leg above the knee on
the posterior and inner sides. Horns very large and massive, diverging
from the base, the divergence in some cases amounting almost to a right
angle; length of horns up to about 34·25 inches.</p>

<p><i>Female.</i> Smaller than the male, and without the mat of hairs on
the forehead; horns smaller and less divergent than in the male, but
much more strongly twisted and crested than in the females of the other
species.</p>

<p>Just as the Kudu, which is spread over the greater part of southern and
eastern Africa, has a smaller relative (the Lesser Kudu) confined to
Somaliland, so the Eland, which has a still wider range, has a near,
but quite distinct, ally in a limited part of western Africa. But in
the latter case the ally is what is called a “representative form,”
since the typical Eland does not occur in the same country, whereas in
Somaliland both the Greater and Lesser Kudus are found together in one
district.</p>

<p>The discovery of the West-African Eland is due to the researches of
the collector, J. Whitfield, who was employed by the thirteenth Earl
of Derby to procure living specimens of the larger Antelopes and
other animals for his celebrated Knowsley Menagerie. With this object
Whitfield made several expeditions to the River Gambia, and on his
return, in 1846, brought with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span> him some horns of a large Antelope
nearly resembling those of the South-African Eland, but “larger,
longer, and much heavier.” In his expedition of 1847 Whitfield
succeeded in procuring from the same district the upper part of the
skull and horns of a male and the flat skins (unfortunately without
heads or feet) of an adult male and female of this animal, of which
the native name was said to be “<i>Gingi-ganga</i>.” It was upon these
specimens that the late Dr. Gray, in October 1847, established his
species <i>Boselaphus derbianus</i>, by publishing a short description
of it in the ‘Annals and Magazine of Natural History’ for that month.
It has been imagined, and even stated in print, that living specimens
of this Eland were received by Lord Derby; but such, we believe, was
not the case. The drawings made by Waterhouse Hawkins, and subsequently
issued in the ‘Gleanings from the Knowsley Menagerie,’ were taken, we
believe, not from living examples, but from the specimens brought home
by Whitfield, as already mentioned.</p>

<p>So far as we know, no further information respecting this remarkable
Antelope was brought to Europe until 1863, when the well-known African
traveller, the late Mr. Winwood Reade, returned to England from one of
his expeditions into Western Africa. Along with other spoils of the
chase, Reade brought with him a head and skin of the present Antelope,
which he at first believed to be undescribed; but on inspecting them,
at Reade’s request, Sclater at once recognized them as belonging to
the little-known Derbian Eland, and persuaded Reade to exhibit them
at a meeting of the Zoological Society of London in May of that year.
Reade’s notes upon this occasion were subsequently published in the
Society’s ‘Proceedings’ and illustrated by a plate drawn by Joseph Wolf
from Mr. Reade’s specimens. So little is known of this most interesting
Antelope, that we propose to give Mr. Reade’s account of it at full
length as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When I was on the Casamanza, a river of Senegambia, in December
1862, I was informed of the existence of an enormous Antelope,
double the size of the Senegal Bullock, with horns lying
backwards, a black mane, and white stripes on its sides. My
French host informed me that it was unknown in France, which is
quite true, as, in fact, its very existence has been denied by
French naturalists. I asked where this animal was most abundant,
and was told in the bamboo-forest of Bambunda, about fifty miles
north-east of Sedhu, where I was staying. I immediately rode
over to a village called Nussera, situated on the borders of
the forest, taking a rifle with me. The hunters of that village
told me that at that time it would be impossible to kill the
<i>Djik-i-junka</i>, the bush being dark, as they expressed it;
but that in a few weeks they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span> burn the tangled undergrowth
of the forest and the high grass of the plains, according to
their annual custom. They would then have a <i>battue</i>;
hundreds of people would collect, and the animated nature,
towards the close of the day, would be driven into a large
plain. There Antelopes, Gazelles, Wild Boars, Porcupines, &amp;c.
would be found so exhausted that many of them could be killed
with sticks; and indeed only a limited number of guns were
allowed in case of accidents. Accordingly I made an arrangement
with them that the first specimen they killed should be sent to
Sedhu, where my friend M. Rapet would buy it for me, and send
it on. Thus I obtained one specimen; the others I purchased at
Macarthy’s Island, Gambia.</p>

  </div>

<p>“I made inquiries of the hunters of Nussera as to the habits of
the Derbian Eland. They told me that the forest was its home;
that it never of its own accord entered the plains; that it
never grazed, but that the bull would tear down branches of
trees for the does and fawns to feed upon.</p>

<p>“A fawn, destined for le Jardin des Plantes, was once sent by M.
Rapet from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span> Casamanza, but it died at Goree. When I was at
Macarthy’s Island, I saw a fawn of this Antelope which was in
the possession of an officer of the 2nd West Indian Regiment; it
was extremely tame, allowing itself to be caressed, and was so
young that it used to be fed on milk.”</p>
</div>

<p>Some further details on the subject will be found in Winwood Reade’s
‘Savage Africa,’ where they are accompanied by a beautiful lithographic
plate representing a herd of Derbyan Elands, drawn by Joseph Wolf and
signed with his initials. This plate (fig. 119, p. 218) by the kindness
of Messrs. Smith, Elder, &amp; Co., we are enabled to reproduce in the
present work.</p>

     <p class="p0 center sm">(P. Z. S. 1898, p. 349.)</p>
  </div>

<p>Since Winwood Reade’s visit to the West Coast, although several heads
of the Derbian Eland have been obtained at the Gambia by Dr. Percy
Rendall and others, little additional information has been received on
the subject. In 1898 Sir R. B. Llewellyn, K.C.M.G., the Governor of the
Colony, brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span> home, amongst other spoils of the chase, a fine pair
of horns of this Antelope, which were exhibited by Sclater at a Meeting
of the Zoological Society on May 5th of that year. A figure of them was
given in the ‘Proceedings,’ which the kindness of the Society enables
us to reproduce (fig. 120, p. 219) on the present occasion. These horns
are of large dimensions, measuring 31 inches in length from the base
in a straight line, and about 11½ inches round their bases. They are
apparently those of an adult male animal.</p>

<p>Mr. J. S. Budgett, F.Z.S., who made a zoological expedition to the
Gambia last year, specially with a view of collecting and observing the
river-fishes, has favoured us with the following notes on what he saw
of the Derbian Eland during several visits to the upper districts of
the Protectorate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Derbian Eland of the Gambia is known to the Mandingoes by
the name of ‘<i>Jinke-janko</i>.’ It does not seem to be very
abundant, and is undoubtedly very shy. During my stay on the
river, several pairs of horns were found in the possession of
natives. Two were met with on the south bank, west of M’Carthy’s
Island, and one at Koina, on the north bank, 100 miles east of
M’Carthy’s Island. All these had been procured in the year 1899.</p>

<p>“A head of a young female was taken from a carcase floating
down the river near Yarbutenda by Mr. P. E. Wainewright, the
travelling Commissioner of the M’Carthy’s Island district, and
presented to me.</p>

<p>“I was assured by Mr. Wainewright that the hair on the neck of
this animal was ‘bluish,’ though the animal was a good deal
decomposed.</p>

<p>“I myself, one day in May 1899, saw a large herd of very large
Antelopes in the distance near the town of Berreef on the north
bank of the Gambia, about 15 miles from Yarbutenda. I have
little doubt that these were Derbian Elands, though I was not
fortunate enough to secure one. They were of an extremely light
colour all over the body, but the head and neck were darker, and
the horns appeared rather short and straight at the distance of
400 yards.”</p>

     <p class="p0 center sm">Front view of the horns of the Derbian Eland.</p>
  </div>

<p>Before concluding our account of the Derbian Eland, it is necessary to
say a few words respecting the supposed new species of Eland described
by M. Rochebrune in the ‘Bulletin’ of the Société Philomathique of
Paris in 1883, and subsequently in his ‘Fauna of Senegambia,’ although
we are not generally willing even to allude to this most untrustworthy
publication. So far as we can make out, the specimens of this animal
promised in the text of M. Rochebrune’s work to be sent to the Gallery
of the Museum of Paris have never reached that Institution, and the
only evidence we have, therefore, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span> its existence is contained in
M. Rochebrune’s descriptions and figures. As well as we can judge from
these and from the extreme improbability of there being a species of
Eland in Senegal different from that of the Gambia, we are inclined to
place the so-called <i>Oreas colini</i> as a synonym of the present
species. The figure of the head given by Rochebrune is stated to have
been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span> taken from a sketch made by “M. le Dr. Colin” of a head of this
animal obtained in the forest of Kita in Senegal. In this figure the
whole head of the animal is represented as of a nearly uniform slaty
grey, with the exception of a patch of reddish hair on the forehead
at the base of the horns and a black patch in the middle of the nose.
These are certainly striking differences, if we could trust them as
being accurate, but we do not know how far M. le Dr. Colin’s sketch
was correctly made, nor what alterations the copier of it may have
introduced into M. Rochebrune’s plate. We cannot admit the existence of
the supposed new species upon such unsatisfactory evidence.</p>

<p>The authorities of the Liverpool Museum have most kindly sent up to us
for examination the specimens of the Derbian Eland now in the Derby
Museum, Liverpool, which are probably those from which the original
figures in the ‘Gleanings’ were drawn by Waterhouse Hawkins. The
frontlet is apparently that of an adult specimen, as will be seen from
our view of it (fig. 121, p. 221) prepared by Mr. Grönvold. The horns
measure 30½ inches in length from base to tip, the tips are nearly 23
inches apart in a straight line. The two flat skins which accompany it
are without heads, and the legs have been cut off at the knees.</p>

<p>In the British Museum there are frontlets of one female and two
male specimens of the Derbian Eland, obtained at the Gambia by the
same collector (Whitfield) and presented by Lord Derby. In the same
collection there is a flat skin brought home by Winwood Reade, and the
head of a female, dried with the skin on, obtained by Dr. Percy Kendall
on the Gambia.</p>

<p>The material available not being, in our opinion, sufficient for the
preparation of a correct figure of the Derbian Eland, we have thought
it best, as our illustration of this Antelope, to copy, on a reduced
scale (Plate C.), the original figures of the Derbian Eland drawn by
Waterhouse Hawkins for plate <span class="allsmcap">XXV.</span> of the ‘Gleanings.’</p>

<p>We admit, however, that these are by no means satisfactory, for the
head and legs of the specimens from which the figures were taken are
absent, and the details as to these parts in the figures were probably
filled up from conjecture. Wolf’s figure of the head of Reade’s
specimen in the ‘Proceedings’ is, no doubt, more accurate, but in this
example the legs are likewise deficient.</p>

</div>

<p class="center sm">LIST OF THE SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES OF ANTELOPES DESCRIBED AS NEW DURING
THE PROGRESS OF THIS WORK.</p>


<h3 class="sm">Genus BUBALIS. (Vol. I. p. 5.)</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Bubalis neumanni.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Bubalis neumanni</i>, <b>Rothschild</b>, Ann. &amp; Mag. N. H.
ser. 6, xx. p. 376 (1897).</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Rothschild has based this species upon two skulls with horns, of
male and female, and parts of a skin obtained by Mr. A. H. Neumann on
the east shore and to the north-east of Lake Rudolf. He describes it as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The horns of this species differ widely from those of <i>Bubalis
major</i> (Blyth), of West Africa, and <i>B. buselaphus</i> (Pall.), of
Northern Africa and Arabia, in being slenderer and in their tips being
inverted, instead of pointing outwards or straight behind. The nearest
ally seems to be <i>B. tora</i> (Gray) of Upper Nubia, Abyssinia, and
Kordofan, which, however, has more slender horns, with more distinct
rings, reaching almost round, a broader forehead, and a generally paler
coloration. The horns also diverge much more in <i>B. tora</i>, as
shown at a glance by the distances between the tips of the horns, as
recorded in R. Ward’s ‘Horn Measurements.’</p>

<p>“The horns of <i>B. neumanni</i> measure as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Circumference at base, ♂ 273 millim., ♀ 183; total length along the
curves, ♂ 420, ♀ 345; tip to tip, ♂ 206, ♀ 249.</p>

<p>“The rings of the horns are not very prominent and do not reach all
round.</p>

<p>“Breadth of skull at forehead, ♂ 100 millim., ♀ 80; length of skull
from base of horn to upper lip, along the side in a straight line: ♂
430, ♀ 403 millim.</p>

<p>“Colour of hair fulvous fawn, much richer on the back, where there are
also some darker spots, which may be stains or natural; below very
much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span> paler. Chin blackish, tip of tail black. The male is brighter
and darker in colour than the female. There are also on the back some
patches with longer, thicker, almost whitish-buff hair, perhaps remains
of the winter fur.”</p>


<h3 class="sm">Genus CONNOCHÆTES. (Vol. I. p. 93.)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Connochætes taurinus johnstoni.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Connochætes taurinus johnstoni</i>, <b>Scl.</b> P. Z. S.
1896, p. 616, pl. xxvii.</p>
</div>

<p>Under this subspecific name Sclater has shortly described and figured
the local form of the Brindled Gnu that occurs on the plains of the
Shiré Highlands, Nyasaland. The difference consists mainly in the
generally brownish colour of the body, and the broad whitish band
across the face beneath the eyes. The mane is black or blackish as in
<i>C. taurinus typicus</i>, not white as in <i>C. albojubatus</i>.</p>

<p>Some good field-notes on the same animal by Mr. R. Crawshay are
appended to Sclater’s remarks.</p>


<h3 class="sm">Genus CEPHALOPHUS. (Vol. I. p. 121.)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cephalophus hecki.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Cephalophus hecki</i>, <b>Matsch.</b> SB. Ges. nat. Freund.
Berlin, 1897, p. 158.</p>
</div>

<p>Herr Matschie has proposed this name for the geographical form of <i>C.
monticola</i> (Bk. of Ant. i. p. 191) which occurs in Mozambique.
The type is an adult male in the Berlin Museum from Mozambique, and
there was also at the time of the description a specimen living in the
Zoological Garden of Berlin.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cephalophus lugens.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Cephalophus lugens</i>, <b>Thos.</b> P. Z. S. 1898, p. 393.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a member of the group of <i>C. monticola</i>, but larger
and of darker colour than any other of the three species of that
section&mdash;<i>C. monticola</i>, <i>C. melanorheus</i>, and <i>C.
æquatorialis</i>. The typical specimens were obtained by Mr. A.
Sharpe’s native hunters in Urori (or Usango), within the frontiers of
German East Africa, north of Lake Nyasa, at an altitude of about 3000
feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cephalophus leucoprosopus.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Cephalophus leucoprosopus</i>, <b>O. Neumann</b>, SB. Ges.
nat. Freund. Berlin, 1899, p. 18.</p>
</div>

<p>This species was based upon a pair of Antelopes living in the
Zoological Garden, Berlin, stated to have been received from Angola.
It is smaller than <i>C. coronatus</i>, and belongs to the same group,
with hornless females (<i>Sylvicapra</i>, Ogilby). Its general colour
is brown with a darker back; legs black; tail above black, beneath
white. The species is remarkable for the colour of the head, in which
the top of the nose and a triangular spot in front of the eyes are
black; the forehead is red; the outer sides of the ears, hinder part of
the head, and under-jaw are brownish. Round the eye runs a broad white
line, which extends towards the nose in sharp contrast to the black
colour; a spot at the base of the ear and the insides of the ears are
also white.</p>


<h3 class="sm">Genus RAPHICERUS. (Vol. II. p. 33.)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Raphicerus campestris.</span></p>

<p>Dr. Jentink (Notes Leyd. Mus. xxii. p. 38, 1900) proposes (for reasons
stated by him) to alter the name of the Antelope which we have
described and figured as <i>Raphicerus campestris</i> to <i>Pediotragus
horstockii</i>.</p>

<p>In the same paper Dr. Jentink describes an allied form from Mossamedes
as <i>Pediotragus kelleni</i>. This species is based on two skulls in
the Leyden Museum, obtained by the brothers v. d. Kellen at Cahama,
Kakulovar River, Upper Cunene.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Raphicerus sharpei.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Raphicerus sharpei</i>, <b>Thos.</b> P. Z. S. 1896, p. 796,
pl. xxxix.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a species of <i>Raphicerus</i> with the white markings of the
Grysbok <i>R. melanotis</i>), but with the feet of the Steinbok (<i>R.
campestris</i>), having no supplementary hoofs.</p>

<p>The type (an adult male) was obtained by Mr. Alfred Sharpe in Southern
Angoniland, B.C.A., and presented to the British Museum.</p>


<h3 class="sm">Genus NESOTRAGUS. (Vol. II. p. 49.)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nesotragus livingstonianus zuluensis.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Nesotragus livingstonianus zuluensis</i>, <b>Thos.</b> Ann. &amp;
<b>Mag.</b> N. H. ser. 7, ii. p. 317 (1898).</p>
</div>

<p>Thomas shows (<i>op. cit.</i>) that the form of <i>Nesotragus
livingstonianus</i> from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span> Zululand, which was referred by him (P. Z.
S. 1893, p. 237) and by us in the present work (ii. p. 55) to the
typical form, is subspecifically different. It is generally of a
grizzled fawn-colour instead of deep rufous, and the fetlocks are only
indistinctly blackish behind, instead of being prominently black all
round. This subspecies seems also to have finer horns.</p>


<h3 class="sm">Genus MADOQUA. (Vol. II. p. 67.)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Madoqua cavendishi.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Madoqua cavendishii</i>, <b>Thos.</b> P. Z. S. 1898, p. 278.</p>
</div>

<p>This species was established on a skull and a skin procured by Mr. H.
S. H. Cavendish during his journey in N.E. Africa, probably in the
neighbourhood of Lake Rudolf. It is a large species apparently allied
to <i>M. damarensis</i>) but of “darker general colour, with broader
and differently-shaped nasals, a higher and more open nasal cavity, and
with separated premaxillæ.”</p>


<h3 class="sm">Genus COBUS. (Vol. II. p. 95.)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cobus smithemani.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Cobus smithemani</i>, <b>Lyd.</b> P. Z. S. 1899, p. 981, pl.
lxxi.</p>
</div>

<p>This species is based on a flat skin obtained by Mr. F. Smitheman,
F.Z.S., in the neighbourhood of Lake Mweru, and indicates a large
Antelope with long shaggy hair on the nape of the neck allied to
<i>C. maria</i>, but without a white patch on the withers, which are
chestnut, and without a white line down the back of the neck.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cobus nigroscapulatus.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Adenota nigroscapulata</i>, <b>Matschie</b>, SB. Ges. nat.
Freund. Berlin, 1899, p. 15.</p>
</div>

<p>This species is based upon an old mounted specimen in the Darmstadt
Museum which was obtained years ago by Harnier on the Bahr-el-Gebel
between 6° and 7° N. lat. The horns have eighteen rings and are nearly
parallel; they measure from base to tip 35·4 centim. in a straight line.</p>

<p>The ground-colour of the fur is yellow; the eye-region, a circular mark
in front of the ears, rim round the nostrils, under lips, under neck,
whole under surface, and inner sides of legs are white; the sides of
the head, the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span> body and a broad band across the breast, the hind
margins of the shoulders, and thighs are yellow; an oval nose-spot, a
broad band from the side of the neck, bordering the white breast, over
the shoulders down to the hoofs are black, as are the groins and the
hinder feet; a white ring surrounds the hoofs.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cobus vardoni loderi.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Cobus vardoni loderi</i>, <b>Lyd.</b> P. Z. S. 1899, p. 983.</p>
</div>

<p>On a skull and horns in the collection of Sir E. G. Loder, F.Z.S., from
an unknown locality (of which a figure is given), Mr. Lydekker bases
this subspecies of the Poku (<i>cf.</i> Bk. of Ant. vol. ii. p. 141).
A somewhat similar specimen was obtained by Mr. Smitheman near Lake
Bangweolo, and it is thought possible therefore that these specimens
may belong to <i>C. smithemani</i>, described in the same paper.</p>


<h3 class="sm">Genus CERVICAPRA. (Vol. II. p. 155.)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cervicapra thomasinæ.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Cervicapra thomasinæ</i>, <b>Scl.</b> P. Z. S. 1900 (May 8th).</p>
</div>

<p>Under this name Sclater has recently described and figured a species
of Reedbuck, met with in Nyasaland, which he has characterized as
follows:&mdash;“<i>C.</i> quoad formam <i>C. arundinum</i> fere similis, sed

</div>

<p>This is either a partially albino variety or a local form of
<i>Cervicapra fulvorufula</i>, discovered by Mr. F. V. Kirby, F.Z.S.,
on the mountains of the Lydenburg district of the Transvaal. It differs
from typical specimens in having the legs white from the knees down,
white hoofs, a pure white tail above and beneath, a white spot on the
forehead, and a more or less clearly defined white stripe down the back
of the neck and along the dorsal line.</p>

<p>There are two specimens of this Antelope in the British Museum,
presented by Mr. Kirby.</p>

</div>

<p>This name has been proposed for the form of <i>Lithocranius</i> that
occurs in Somaliland. It is rather larger and has finer horns, as we
have stated (see our remarks, vol. iii. p. 230). It is now pointed out
that the typical form of East Africa is redder than that of Somaliland,
that it has black knee-tufts, and shows a slight difference in the
white markings of the tail.</p>


<h3 class="sm">Genus HIPPOTRAGUS. (Vol. IV. p. 3.)</h3>

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Hippotragus langheldi</i>, <b>Matsch.</b> SB. Ges. nat.
Freund. Berlin, 1898, p. 182.</p>
</div>

<p>Under this name it seems that the same geographical form is described
as that which we have called <i>Hippotragus equinus rufo-pallidus</i>
(suprà, p. 14), ex <i>H. rufo-pallidus</i>, Neumann, P. Z. S. 1898,
p. 850. The type of <i>H. langheldi</i> is from Tabora, German East
Africa; it is diagnosed as follows:&mdash;“<i>H. bakeri</i> affinis; colli
jubâ tricolore, subtùs albâ, supernè brunneâ nigro marginatâ; pectore
nigrescente, caudæ basi nigerrimâ.”</p>
